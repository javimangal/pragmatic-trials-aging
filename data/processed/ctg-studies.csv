Context: The use of prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening for prostate cancer is controversial because of a lack of evidence that such screening saves lives when applied within a population and because such testing can lead to invasive downstream biopsies and aggressive treatment that is associated with a high risk of permanent side effects (e.g. impotence, incontinence). Almost all professional societies (American Cancer Society, American Urologic Association, American College of Physicians, United States Preventive Services Task Force) advocate that patients receive education and complete an informed decision-making discussion with their medical providers about the pros and cons of the PSA test, as well as their personal preferences, before proceeding with this test.

ECAC is characterised by complete or partial collapse of central airways on exhalation. In some cases, this can cause persistent breathlessness and severely limited exercise capacity. Current treatment options for ECAC are very limited. Standard assistive breathing devices such as CPAP machines are sometimes used to relieve symptoms at night or at rest. This does not address breathlessness during activity which drives accumulation of disability over time.

The main aims of this project are to assess the effect of a portable CPAP (pCPAP) device on exercise capacity and symptoms and evaluate the feasibility of wearing pCPAP at home during routine activities. Lightweight battery-powered portable CPAP devices have been recently developed to facilitate travel to remote areas by people with Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA). Patients with ECAC can wear them during physical activity to prevent airway collapse but their potential benefits have not been evaluated in clinical trials.

For this study, the investigators will recruit 20 patients with ECAC who will attend for two study visits 4-6 weeks apart in a single centre (The Royal Papworth Hospital). The primary outcome measure will be a shuttle walk test performed repeatedly with and without pCPAP in a randomised order. Secondary outcomes will include assessment of activity level, breathlessness, quality of life ,pCPAP usage and its acceptability. The study will evaluate a pragmatic way of CPAP titration and application. Previously acquired diagnostic baseline computed tomography (CT) scans will be analysed with a novel Functional Respiratory Imaging (FRI) tool. This software tool will enable retrospective reflections on the changes occurring within the lungs for patients with ECAC.

"15","NCT01545401","Empowering Primary Care Providers and Patients to Improve Chronic Disease Outcomes: The EMPOWER Participatory Action Research (EMPOWER - PAR)","COMPLETED","BACKGROUND

Chronic disease management (CDM) presents enormous challenges to the primary care workforce due to the rising epidemic of cardiovascular risk factors. The Chronic Care Model (CCM) was proven effective in improving chronic disease outcomes in developed countries. Evidence that this model works in developing countries is still scarce. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the EMPOWER-PAR intervention (multifaceted CDM strategies based on the CCM) in managing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and hypertension (HPT), using readily available resources in the Malaysian public primary care setting.

METHODS

This is a pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial - participatory action research which is currently being conducted in 10 public primary care clinics in Selangor and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Five clinics are randomly selected to provide the EMPOWER-PAR intervention for 1 year, while the other 5 clinics continued with usual care. Each clinic recruits consecutive T2DM and HPT patients who fulfil the inclusion and exclusion criteria over a 2-week period.

The EMPOWER-PAR intervention consists of creating/strengthening a multidisciplinary CDM Team; and training the team to utilise the Global CV Risks Self-Management Booklet to support patient care and reinforcing them to utilise relevant clinical practice guidelines to aid management and prescribing.

For T2DM, primary outcome is the change in the proportion of patients achieving target HbA1c of \<6.5%. For HPT without T2DM, primary outcome is the change in the proportion of patients achieving target blood pressure of \<140/90 mmHg. Secondary outcomes include the proportion of patients achieving targets serum lipid profile, body mass index and waist circumference. Other outcome measures include medication adherence levels, process of care and prescribing patterns. Patients' assessment of their chronic disease care, providers' perception, attitude and perceived barriers in delivering the care and cost-effectiveness of the intervention are also evaluated.

CONCLUSION

Results from this study will provide objective evidence of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a multifaceted intervention based on the CCM in resource constraint public primary care setting.

Sleep disruption is particularly prevalent among HCWs providing frontline COVID-19 care. It can have direct consequences on their cognitive and emotional functioning, as well as on patient safety. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for insomnia (CBTi) is a first-line treatment for insomnia. It has been shown to improve sleep health and wellbeing in the general population. However, there are significant barriers to delivering CBTi to frontline HCWs, including limited availability of trained sleep therapists and high costs. To address this, a Canada-wide randomized controlled trial is developed to determine the effectiveness of a digital CBTi program on the sleep health, mental health, wellness, and overall quality of life of frontline HCWs caring for COVID-19 patients. This study may provide an easily accessible and scalable sleep health intervention that can be included as part of a national and global response to the COVID-19 pandemic.","NO","Insomnia|Post Traumatic Stress Disorder|Anxiety Disorders|Depression","BEHAVIORAL: Digital Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (dCBTi)","Assessing changes in the nature and severity of insomnia:, Change in score on the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI ) from baseline to 12 weeks.

Primary objective To demonstrate that, in patients with history of recent atrial fibrillation treated with the best recommended therapies, the addition of valsartan 320 mg is superior to placebo in reducing atrial fibrillation recurrence.

Study design The GISSI-AF is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study. Patients with a history of atrial fibrillation will be centrally randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either valsartan or placebo.

GISSI-AF will be a pragmatic trial, with broad selection criteria to mimic real clinical practice as much as possible. Since no special examinations or procedures are required for the trial, the economic impact on the National Health Service will be minimized and use of resources likely to be optimized. The enrollment period will last 12 months. The patients will be followed up for 12 months from study entry

All prescribed treatments for AF or for the underlying cardiovascular diseases, including ACE-inhibitors, amiodarone and betablockers, will be allowed:

The important initial period of trauma care is often chaotic and prone to errors. The World Health Organization created a Trauma Care Checklist (TCC), which improved key performance indicators of care at tertiary hospitals but encountered factors which decreased its uptake. The investigators propose the use of a model Trauma Intake Form (TIF) with potential to achieve the benefits of the TCC, but with automatic usage and with accompanying improvements in documentation for key elements of care. It is especially oriented for smaller hospitals. The investigators propose a pragmatic randomized clinical trial with introduction of the TIF at 8 hospitals sequentially, with start times randomized by stepped-wedge design. Specifically, the investigators aim to determine the effectiveness the TIF to function as a checklist for increasing the appropriate use of key performance indicators during care of the injured in emergency units of non-tertiary hospitals in Ghana, as assessed by independent observers; to determine the percent of injured patients with adequate data on initial assessment before vs. after introduction of the TIF in emergency units of non-tertiary hospitals in Ghana; and to increase the capacity of the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology and the network of non-tertiary hospitals in southern Ghana to undertake high-quality trauma care research, including clinical trials.","YES","Behavior Problem","OTHER: Improving initial care of the injured","Appropriate Use of Key Performance Indicators in Initial Assessment and Management of the Injured at Non-tertiary Hospitals in Ghana, The percentage of injured patients for whom key performance indicated eg.

Research so far suggests it is popular with patients, they would like to continue to use it in clinic and it is feasible. Benefits of its routine repeated use is untested, notably its impact on improving QOL and in reducing emotional distress, especially within the first year after treatment when patients are more likely to benefit from repeated use of the PCI.

The overarching aim of the proposed research is to explore whether the routine use of the PCI in review clinics during the first year following head and neck cancer treatment can improve patients quality of life.

The primary outcome is an improvement in QOL. Secondary outcomes are:

social-emotional scale, distress thermometer and health economics.

This will be a pragmatic cluster randomised control trial with consultants randomised to either 'using or 'not using' the PCI at clinic. It will involve two centres. 416 patients from at least 10 consultant clusters are required to show a clinically meaningful difference in the primary outcome.

Intervention; Patient completion of the PCI and its inclusion into the regular review clinic consultation is the 'intervention' and is compared to standard out-patient follow-up.

ASCVD is the leading cause of death and disability in Brazil and therefore prevention guidelines recommend LDL-C reduction with the aim of reducing disease burden in individuals at risk. Studies have shown a clear hiatus on awareness and treatment of cholesterol in Brazil.

These nine predictors include Furosemide intravenous 40 milligrams or more; Admissions in the past one year; Medifund status; Frequent emergency department use; Anti-depressants treatment in past one year; Charlson comorbidity index; End Stage Renal Failure on dialysis; Subsidized ward stay and Geriatric patient. The investigators have combined these nine predictors into the FAM-FACE-SG score for FA risk (defined as 3 or more inpatient admissions in the following 12 months). The FAM-FACE-SG risk score has the advantage of being deployed in our hospital's enterprise data repository known as Electronic Health Intelligence System or eHINTs for short, on a real-time or near real-time basis. On a daily basis, data from multiple data sources are extracted, transformed and loaded onto the eHINTS system. The system can be programmed to run every midnight to provide risk scores the following morning for patients admitted the previous day.

In this trial, the intervention is to combine the FAM-FACE-SG risk score in addition to a decision making algorithm to guide referrals to various transitional care services based on needs assessment on nursing and function.

"47","NCT02230267","High-intensity Exercise and Fall Prevention Boot Camp for Parkinson's Disease","COMPLETED","Several animal and human epidemiologic studies have provided evidence that exercise may be neuroprotective in Parkinson's disease (PD). Exercise may forestall diagnosis and, in the case of those who have already been diagnosed with PD, it may slow the observed neurodegeneration. Unfortunately, because this line of research is in early stages, there is little evidence to indicate what biological mechanisms underlie the neuroprotection that is conferred with exercise. Toward this end, it is possible that an interaction between endogenous antioxidant enzymes, inflammatory processes, and reactive oxygen species may be associated with exercise improvements in PD.

One of the most common reasons for premature death in PD is falls. Several meta-analyses have concluded that exercise training programs focused on balance and/or strength training are effective at improving aspects of balance. Taken together, the current body of evidence suggests that exercise may be neuroprotective and balance/strength training may decrease the likelihood of a fall. The combination of these efficacious treatment modalities (exercise and balance/strength training) in a comprehensive treatment approach to improve PD symptoms and balance has been previously reported at relatively mild or moderate exercise intensities. Because recent research has suggested that patients with PD may benefit more from more physically intense programs, we are proposing a more aggressive approach with regard to exercise intensity and frequency in the present trial. The primary purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility and safety of a high intensity exercise approach to PD. A secondary purpose is to determine the trajectory of change in outcomes over the duration of the trial from a high intensity fall prevention program. It is hoped that a signal of efficacy will allow this trial to progress to a comparative effectiveness trial. An important innovative design element is collecting biological assays to better understand the mechanism underlying the anticipated clinical improvements.

Aim 1 is to test the feasibility of a high-intensity exercise and fall prevention boot camp (HIBC) in patients with PD by analyzing adherence and whether they achieve minimum Centers for Disease Control exercise standards (150 min/wk moderate level aerobic exercise; strengthening at least two times per week) for the duration of the trial. Aim 2 is to determine if participation in an 8-week HIBC under the direction of a physical therapist is safe for individuals with PD. Secondary Aim 3 is to determine if participation in an 8-week HIBC will produce a signal of efficacy for several physical outcomes: falls per physical activity ratio, balance efficacy, motor activity, fatigue, muscle strength, bone health, cognition/mood, and quality of life. Secondary Aim 4 is to determine if participation in an 8-week HIBC will produce a signal of efficacy for biological outcomes, anti-inflammatory cytokines and anti-oxidant enzymes. An additional exploratory aim will be an analysis of BDNF val66val, val66met, met66met polymorphisms to determine if there is a differential response to exercise.

This trial is innovative because it utilizes a high intensity comprehensive exercise treatment approach (aerobic exercise, strengthening, and balance training). To our knowledge, there have been no trials of individuals with PD who have participated in a trial of this intensity in a group ""boot camp"" setting. Another innovative design element is the use of three novel assessments: biological assays of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, endogenous anti-oxidant enzymes and a novel assessment of falls (falls per physical activity ratio).

Participants will be randomly assigned into either an 8-week HIBC group or an 8-week usual care control group (standard, low intensity group therapy class) under the direction of physical therapists. Each group will have 15 participants with a 1:5 patient-to-therapist ratio. The HIBC will be 1.5 hours daily, Monday through Friday. Participants will be required to attend 3 out of the 5 days. The protocol of the HIBC will include the following exercise components: A. 30 minutes of moderate-high intensity aerobic exercise; B. 15 minutes of strengthening the major muscle groups; C. 15 minutes of balance training; and, D. 15 minutes of interspersed rest and stretching. Participants will rotate through these four exercise components. Participants will have one baseline test and assessments at the 2-week, 4 week, 8-week, and 6-month points. Outcomes of the primary aims (Aim 1 and Aim 2) will be frequency counts of participation, adverse events, and compliance with exercise. The outcomes for the secondary aims will include measures of balance and falls, physical capacity, fatigue, exercise/physical activity behavior, and biological assays.","NO","Parkinson's Disease","OTHER: High intensity exercise and balance training|OTHER: Usual care arm exercise","Frequency feasibility, The number of participants that attend and participate in the treatment at least 3 times per week for 8 weeks., After completion of the 8 week trial|Aerobic feasibility, The number of participants that complete at least 150 minutes per week of moderate intensity exercise (70%+ of their estimated HR maximum).

This intervention provides a framework for a nationally generalizable model to improve best practices in generalist-level palliative care in CF.

Objectives:

Aim 1: Implement a primary palliative care intervention comprising screening-and-triage workflows, best practice treatment guides for high frequency problems, patient/family and provider education, and a quality improvement (QI) toolkit.

Aim 2: Evaluate feasibility, uptake, and preliminary outcomes during a multisite pragmatic, implementation trial of the intervention at 5 diverse Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Centers.

Subaim 2.1: Evaluate feasibility and uptake as measured by rates of screening and treatment delivery.

Hypothesis 1: Related to feasibility and uptake of the intervention:

1. \> 80% of individuals with CF of all ages will receive an annual palliative care screening.
2. \> 25% of individuals with CF will receive a palliative care screening prompted by hospitalization, new diagnosis of CF-Related Diabetes, need for transplantation, or another disease- or treatment-specific trigger.

"64","NCT05321680","Withdrawal of Antidementia Drugs in Advanced Dementia (WADAD)","COMPLETED","Dementia is a chronic progressive mental disorder that adversely affects higher cortical functions, including cognition and behavior leading up to disability and dependence in daily life activities. It has become a major public health concern because of its increasing prevalence, chronicity, burden for caregivers, and the high personal and financial costs needed for care. Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia, occurring in 5% to 7% of individuals older than 60. In Portugal, Santana et al study estimated that 160 287 people above 60 years had a diagnosis of dementia in 2013 (prevalence of 5,9%).The increasing national and international prevalence of dementia and its associated burden then imparts a high priority on delivering safe and effective treatment options.

Currently approved treatments available for the symptomatic management of mild to moderate AD include cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) (donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine) and a N-methyl- D-aspartate receptor antagonist (memantine). These drugs are also given off-label for other types of dementia (vascular and mixed dementias), with treatment continuing through advanced disease stages. Given that ChEIs have demonstrated short-term modest stabilization on measures of cognition and global functioning in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), several practice guidelines have proposed ChEIs for the treatment of all stages of AD, with some advocating ChEI discontinuation if tolerability issues arise, or if there is no longer a noticeable clinical benefit. Further studies in this setting are important as patients with severe dementia are more functionally impaired, present with comorbid illnesses, posing a higher risk of polypharmacy. In addition, ChEIs have a potential risk of adverse events including nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramping, fatigue, and weight loss. Less commonly, ChEI might be associated with rhabdomyolysis, convulsions, falls, syncope, pneumonia and death. Because cognitive and behavioral impairments change during the progressive disease course, the effects of medications may be unpredictable, especially over long durations of treatment. It might be challenging to weigh minimally beneficial effects against predicted harms of continued treatment, considering both patient and caregiver-centered care goals besides less clinically relevant cognitive outcomes.

Only a small number of discontinuation RCTs were conducted to date but involved relatively few participants with heterogeneous designs, disease severities and outcomes. As so, clinicians take individualized discontinuation decisions and the only consensual domains are a lack of response and a loss of effectiveness. The present pragmatic clinical trial will compare the efficacy of maintaining pharmacological treatment versus treatment cessation on cognition, behavior, functional disability and quality of life of patients and caregivers, among patients with severe dementia due to AD, with or without small vessel subcortical vascular disease. The investigators will consider other important endpoints besides cognitive functioning including mood, apathy, energy and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Moreover, this trial will try to look for outcomes that engage patients and families in treatment decisions.","NO","Dementia","OTHER: Treatment withdrawal","BADLS (Bristol Activities of Daily Living Scale), Progression to disability (defined as a loss of 2 of 4 basic functions, or 6 of 11 instrumental functions); total score varies from 0 (totally independent) to 60 (totally dependent), 6 months|Quality of life of patients and caregivers, EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D); score varies from 0 to 100 using a Visual analogue scale, 6 months","ALL","CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,16,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT","2021-03-01","2021-12-01","2022-03-20","2022-04-11","","2022-04-11","Centro Hospitalar Universitário de São João, Porto, 4200-319, Portugal","other"

"72","NCT05756829","Type 1 Diabetes Virtual Self-management Education and Support","RECRUITING","OVERVIEW: People living with type 1 diabetes (T1D) are expected to fit self-management and regular clinical consultations into busy lives. T1D self-management programs that offer frequent contact with care teams are most effective in helping patients achieve optimal glycemic control. However, this is difficult to deliver in the context of current T1D care which involves time-consuming in-person visits during working hours. The proposed study will test a virtual health care intervention to deliver ""high frequency, low touch"" care aimed at improving metabolic control, while reducing the burden on individuals and their healthcare teams.

STUDY DESIGN: A pragmatic multicenter, open-label, randomized trial to evaluate the short-term effectiveness of a multifaceted virtual health care intervention in improving glycemic control in individuals with T1D. Planned recruitment is 580 participants from 10 specialized T1D centres in Ontario.

INTERVENTION: Our intervention will include 1) frequent, brief virtual visits between patients with T1D and certified diabetes educators (conducted in real time using a secure telemedicine video interface accessible from any PC, tablet or smart phone) combined with automatic appointment reminders, and 2) a centralized web-based platform to provide educational classes, tools, and resources for diabetes self-management. Virtual visits will be an adjunct to routine in-clinic visits for blood pressure monitoring, foot checks, and surveillance for other complications of diabetes. This approach aims to enable patients to receive more education and support than is feasible in traditional health care models, and in a way that is more seamless (i.e. results in fewer disruptions to their daily life) and tailored to their individual needs based on their stage in life.","NO","type1diabetes","OTHER: High frequency, low touch virtual health care","Change from Baseline HbA1c at 6 months, Baseline, pre-intervention AND Up to 4 weeks after the intervention","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,580,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: SUPPORTIVE_CARE","2023-05-10","2024-12-31","2025-06-30","2023-03-06","","2023-08-25","Unity Health Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, M5B 1W8, Canada|Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 1X5, Canada","other"
"73","NCT04377529","Evaluating the Impact of a Champion on Implementation of the Back Skills Training (BeST) Program in Canada","COMPLETED","There is global recognition in clinical guidelines and governing bodies that low back pain (LBP) should be managed with a biopsychosocial approach. Despite this, research indicates that physiotherapists, who treat the majority of LBP patients in the community, do not feel confident in using this treatment approach. Previous work to support implementation in this field has resulted in low uptake and has highlighted several barriers to implementation, including the need for additional ongoing support. The use of a local champion to support implementation has been successful in other fields and thus, represents a viable strategy to explore. Before undertaking a fully powered trial to evaluate the effectiveness of a champion for implementation, a pilot study is being conducted to determine the feasibility of the intervention as well as determining the feasibility of using a cluster randomised controlled trial to evaluate it.

In this study, a pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial design will be used with an embedded qualitative interview study. Physiotherapists will be recruited who manage LBP in any publicly funded physiotherapy departments within Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. Individual sites will be grouped into clusters based on their number of full-time physiotherapists, geography, and organisational relationships. All participants will be asked to complete a previously developed online training course to upskill them to deliver a biopsychosocial evidence-based intervention for LBP. Clusters randomised to receive a local champion will receive additional support from their champion. A basic champion training package has been developed based on known barriers in the literature. This will be tailored by co-developing aspects with study champions based on a comprehensive assessment of perceived implementation barriers using the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) and the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation and Behaviour (COM-B) model. A range of physiotherapist-level outcomes pre-post training will be measured and implementation of the evidence based biopsychosocial intervention will be monitored during a 6-month period after completion of the online training. After this 6-month period, a purposive sample of physiotherapists from each cluster who had both implemented and failed to implement the biopsychosocial intervention will be interviewed.","NO","Low Back Pain","BEHAVIORAL: Local Champion","% of target recruitment reached (champions), We aim to recruit at least 1 champion from each cluster., 6 months post-intervention","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,39,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: OTHER","2019-09-01","2022-08-30","2022-08-30","2020-05-06","","2023-10-23","Health Science Centre, Saint John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, NL A1B 3V6, Canada","behavioral"
"74","NCT01893229","Comparative Efficacy and Acceptability of Antimanic Drugs in Acute Mania","UNKNOWN","Background:

Bipolar disorder is one of the most common mental illnesses affecting 1%-4% of the population, and one of the leading causes of worldwide disability. Mania is a condition of excessively elevated mood, characterizes bipolar disorder, and usually is a main cause of hospitalization. Mood stabilisers and antipsychotic drugs have long been the maintenance treatment of acute mania with and without psychotic symptoms. Though clinical trails have been demonstrated that these drugs are individually more effective than placebo in the relatively long term (e.g 4, 8 weeks). However, in the pragmatic practice, patient at acute mania urgently want to see the effectiveness, and psychiatrist under great pressure and are in great need to evaluate the very short-term effectiveness (e.g one week). If the first attempted antimanic drug fails, psychiatrist need the evidence that which medication should be to added on or switch to.

Objectives:

one main aim is to rank the short-term ( e.g.one and two week) effectiveness and acceptability of the common anti-mania drugs, including Lithium, Valproate, Oxcarbazepine, Quetiapine, Olanzapine, or Ziprasidone. Secondary aim is to investigate which medication to add on for non-responders or switch to.

Methods:

The study setting: it is expected that 120 subjects with a diagnose of DSM-IV bipolar I disorder will be recruited from Guangzhou Psychiatric Hospital, the earliest psychiatric hospital in the history of China established by Dr.J. G. Kerr in 1898.

Design:This study is a randomized, controlled trial. Participants with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) diagnosis of bipolar I disorder, manic or mixed episode will be randomly assigned to a treatment of Lithium, Valproate, Oxcarbazepine, Quetiapine, Olanzapine, or Ziprasidone. In the following conditions, participants will take another antimanic drug as a combination medication: 1) those who have a reduction in YMRS scores less than 25% after one week of treatment; 2) those who have a reduction in YMRS scores less than 50% after two weeks of treatment; or 3) those who have a increase in YMRS more than 30% at day 4. An antipsychotic (Quetiapine, Olanzapine, and Ziprasidone) will be added on for those who use lithium, Valproate or Oxcarbazepine as a first attempted medication; while Lithium, Valproate, or Oxcarbazepine will be added on for those who use an antipsychotic as a first attempted medication. Those participants who are recognized as non-response/partial response to two combined medications after 6 weeks of treatment will switch to Modified Electroconvulsive Therapy (MECT).

Measures: Primary outcome measures are change scores on the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) and dropout rates. Secondary outcome measures include Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) Scale, Global Assessment Scale (GAS), Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (TESS), and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS).

Response criteria: \<25% reduction in YMRS scores or \>=4 scores of CGI is defined as non-response. 25-49% reduction in YMRS scores from baseline as well as \<=3 scores of Clinical General Impression (CGI) is recognized as partial response.\>= 50% reduction in YMRS as well as 1 (very much improved) or 2 scores (much improved) of CGI is recognized as response. Remission is defined as a YMRS score \<=12 and CGI score equal to 1 or 2.","NO","Bipolar Disorder","DRUG: Lithium|DRUG: Valproate|DRUG: Oxcarbazepine|DRUG: Quetiapine|DRUG: Olanzapine|DRUG: Ziprasidone","Change from baseline in Young Mania Rating Scale at 2 weeks and 6 weeks, Young Mania Rating Scale is used to assess hypomania/mania symptoms, Baseline, 2 weeks and 6 weeks|rate of dropout (treatment discontinuation), to compare the rates of treatment discontinuation of different drugs because of side effect or effectiveness, 1,2,4,6 weeks","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT","PHASE4",120,"OTHER_GOV","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (PARTICIPANT)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT","2013-09","2015-12","2015-12","2013-07-08","","2015-03-17","Guangzhou Psychiatric Hospital, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510370, China|Guangzhou Psychiatric Hospital, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510370, China","drug"

Compared with Whites, BIPOC populations in the US experience disproportionate health consequences from commercial cigarette use. Few evidence-based cessation treatments (EBCTs) have been specifically developed, evaluated, or implemented for BIPOC populations. Moreover, uptake of EBCT (e.g. medication, counseling) is lower among BIPOC populations. Reasons for the failure to engage BIPOC patients in EBCTs are complex and multi-level (e.g., patient, provider, healthcare system). To address these gaps, the investigators will assess the added effectiveness of an approach to augment the standard of care with longitudinal proactive outreach to connect BIPOC adults with EBCT. The proposed multi-level intervention leverages the electronic health record to identify patients who smoke, who can then be proactively engaged via culturally tailored outreach to connect them to EBCT.

Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is the most common and devastating complication after total hip replacement (THR). Between 0.5 to 2% of primary THR (first time hip replacement), and 8-10% of revision THR (replacement of a hip prosthesis) will become infected.1 The introduction of local antibiotics blended into bone cement has led to a reduction in postoperative infection in primary THR by half.2 Unfortunately, cement can't always be used in relevant quantities.

The number of primary and revision surgeries of the hip is projected to increase dramatically. Therefore, the need for a feasible infection prophylaxis that is applicable for complex primary and revision THR in addition to antibiotics loaded cement is urgent.

Impacted morselized bone allograft is often used in (revision) THR to fill bone defects. Morselized allograft has been used as a carrier for local antibiotic treatment in multiple pilot studies and appears to be an attractive and effective treatment option, both for already infected joints and as a prophylactic measure in high-risk patients (e.g. THR revision surgeries). Nonetheless, a pivotal trial to support its use in THR is lacking. The aim of this pragmatic randomized controlled double blinded drug trial is to investigate whether antibiotic impregnated bone graft (AIBG) decreases the risk of infection after hip arthroplasty compared to controls treated with placebo impregnated bone graft. Patients scheduled for elective THR will be randomized to receive AIBG or a placebo impregnated bone graft.

2. SUMMARY OF RESEARCH (ABSTRACT) Research Question: Are post-operative antibiotics required following surgery for patients with mandible fractures? Background: Mandible fractures are the commonest facial fractures needing surgery and account for a significant percentage of the acute workload in Oral \& Maxillofacial Surgery (OMFS) units. The UK records over 6000 new cases per year. Patients having surgery for mandible fractures have a theoretical risk of developing surgical site infection, due to the proximity of the fracture lines to the oral cavity microbes and the presence of foreign body (titanium fixation miniplates). For this reason, clinicians often prescribe antibiotics after surgery, to reduce the risk of infection. Previous systematic reviews and a multicentre cohort study performed by this team, revealed significant clinical variation in post-operative antibiotic prescription amongst UK OMFS clinicians and the presence of clinical equipoise. Antibiotic overuse can lead to antibiotic resistance and other antibiotic-related side effects; judicious antibiotic use and stewardship is of paramount importance.

Aim: To determine whether post-operative antibiotics are required at all, following surgery for mandible fractures, and, if so, what is the most clinically- and cost-effective regimen

Objectives:

Primary Objective To conduct a Randomized Controlled Trial (MANTRA) in order to establish the non-inferiority (or not) of not giving post-operative antibiotics versus 2 other post-operative antibiotic regimens. An internal pilot phase will optimise recruitment and retention.

Secondary Objectives

* Measure the cost-effectiveness of the proposed antibiotic pathways
* Assess patient and clinician acceptability to change clinical practice
* Process evaluation to inform dissemination and implementation Methods: The investigators designed and propose the MANTRA RCT to compare 3 post-operative antibiotic approaches to prevent Surgical Site Infections (SSIs) following surgery for mandible fractures. The MANTRA trial is a large open label, multicentre study in NHS OMFS units. The 3 study arms represent the most common clinical pathways in the UK based on previous work; the control group is the approach prescribed by most UK OMFS clinicians. All patients will receive 1 dose of IV antibiotics (co-amoxiclav 1.2g, if no penicillin allergy, which is the most commonly used prophylactic antibiotic currently) on induction of anaesthesia, prior to their surgery.

The participants will be randomised to the following (1:1:1):

Group A: No further antibiotics Group B: 2 further postoperative IV doses of co-amoxiclav 1.2g Group C: 2 further postoperative IV doses (as above), followed by a 5-day course of oral co-amoxiclav 625mg every 8 hours if no penicillin allergy (Control).

Trial processes will be optimised by an internal pilot phase ensuring we recruit, randomise, and retain participants with clear progression criteria. We will also conduct cost-effectiveness analyses and process evaluation for dissemination and implementation

Timeline:

Start of grant: 1st July 2023 Start of RCT / pilot: 1st January 2024 End of pilot: 30th June 2024 End of recruitment: 31st December 2026 End of follow-up: 30th June 2027 Completion: 31st December 2027

Impact and dissemination:

* Practice changing outputs that standardise the use of antibiotics in mandible fractures in the NHS and provide a framework for other surgical prophylaxis research
* A bespoke clinical dissemination plan via an engagement and training legacy
* Cost-effectiveness data to inform policy making
* A research legacy and change of culture in the specialty of OMFS","NO","Mandible Fracture|Post-operative Antibiotics","DRUG: Different post-operative antibiotic regimens following surgical treatment of mandible fractures","Surgical Site Infection, Incidence of Surgical Site Infection (CDC definition) following surgery for mandible fractures, 30 days","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT","PHASE3",2907,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT","2024-04-01","2027-06-30","2027-12-31","2023-07-27","","2024-03-04","East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust, Oldham, Greater Manchester, OL28HS, United Kingdom","drug"

"87","NCT03588104","""POWER2DM Evaluation Campaign""","COMPLETED","Rationale: Hyperglycaemia is an important cause of long-term macro-and microvascular complications in all patients with diabetes mellitus. However, only a small fraction of the patients with diabetes reaches the set target of glycemic control. Problems with adequate self-management usually underlie problems to maintain glycaemic control. Thus, patients need more support in order to reduce the burden and increase the effectiveness of their diabetes self-management. One way to do this is by using integrated technologies and personalized plans for diabetes care. For this purpose, the POWER2DM support system was developed to give patients insight into their condition and support diabetes patients and their health care professionals in setting and achieving self-management goals using predictive computer model simulations and behavioural action plans.

Objective: To provide proof of concept that POWER2DM is safe and effective in improving glycaemic control, improving behavioural/psychosocial and lifestyle markers, and to assess the cost-effectiveness of the approach and to highlight any potential issues that may impede implementation.

Study design: This is a pragmatic randomised controlled trial with 9 months follow-up in which patients will be randomised 1:1 to either Power2DM support (Power2DM group) or usual care (usual care group). There will be evaluation moments at baseline, after 11 weeks, 22 weeks and 37 weeks.

Study population: 230 patients with diabetes (N=115 type 1 diabetes (T1D), N=115 type 2 diabetes (T2D)) recruited from out-patient clinics in the Netherlands (Leiden University Medical Centre and affiliating teaching hospitals N=115) and Córdoba, Spain (Reina Sofia University Hospital N=115).

Intervention: The POWER2DM support group will receive access to the prototype 2 of the POWER2DM system. This system consists of two components: 1) the web-based Shared Decision Making Dashboard, used to set self-management goals together with a health care professional with the use of both short- and long-term predictive computer simulation models, and 2) the POWER2DM Self-Management Support System as a mobile application and webpage, used to support behavioural change in DM self-management.

"89","NCT03344601","PHysical Activity and Exercise Outcomes in Huntington's Disease","UNKNOWN","Huntington's disease (HD) is a genetic, degenerative neurological disease that affects individuals in their third-fourth decade of life and individuals can live 15-20 years with manifest HD. The complex disease symptoms, including motor, cognitive and behavioural impairments, result in loss of functional independence and progressive escalation of healthcare costs. The personal, social and economic consequences of HD are devastating, especially as there are currently no disease modification therapies available.

Environmental factors, including exercise and physical activity, have the potential to minimize the functional impact of HD. Animal models of HD have provided the first evidence that exercise has the potential to delay or alter disease progression. A range of studies in clinical populations have shown that short-term exercise (\< 3 months) is well tolerated and has the potential to improve quality of life, fitness and motor impairments in HD. Despite these promising studies, there are critical knowledge gaps that prevent the intelligent application of exercise as a therapeutic intervention in HD. Firstly, there have been no prospective evaluations of the potential role of physical activity and exercise in disease modification in HD. To date, only retrospective data has suggested that lifestyle factors, including sedentary behavior, could negatively affect disease progression in HD. Secondly, it is not known if sustained exercise (\> 3 months) is feasible, and if it has the potential to improve cognitive outcomes, such as has been shown in other neurodegenerative diseases. Such longer-term studies are essential to elucidate the potential for exercise to have a disease-modifying effect; the mechanisms through which such improvement may occur have yet to be explored.

In this trial, the investigators will employ a systematic approach for routinely collecting prospective physical activity and fitness data and monitoring physical activity behaviour in 120 individuals with HD. The investigators will use a database to track physical activity and exercise behaviour alongside standardized disease-specific outcome measures during two annual visits. Assessment will incorporate VO2max, a surrogate measure of fitness and a direct measure of oxygen uptake related to central nervous system (CNS) function and structure, and the use of wearable technologies (Gene-activ activity monitors) that capture and quantify dose (frequency, duration, intensity) of physical activity in a large HD cohort. The investigators will further conduct a within-cohort randomized control trial (RCT) of a 12-month exercise intervention in HD, comparing a supported structured aerobic exercise training program to activity as usual. This intervention will also incorporate a physical activity coaching program developed and evaluated by our group with a view to encouraging longer term exercise uptake.","NO","Huntington Disease","BEHAVIORAL: physical activity","Data completeness, The amount of trial data completed will be recorded.

Time to cART start is currently approximately 2-4 weeks after diagnosis, mostly deferred for reasons of waiting for baseline blood test results; in particular HIV genotype, CD4 count, OI screen and logistics of a consultant clinical review. Whilst there is a clear rationale for this delay there is a risk of loss to follow-up as well as the potential risk of onward viral transmission. The balance between ""readiness"" to start ART against pragmatic and practical safe initiation of treatment needs to be tested using currently available safe potent antiretroviral agents in a head-to-head comparison study to allow careful rigorous comparisons of outcomes.

This study will recruit 36 newly diagnosed HIV patients to be started on treatment immediately upon diagnosis. This would optimally be within 7 days, for eligibility to the study up to 14 days will be permissible.

"100","NCT04360694","RandomizEd ClinicAL triaL on the Efficacy and saFety of Incremental Hemodialysis (REAL-LIFE)","RECRUITING","Background: The thrice-weekly hemodialysis (HD) regimen is widely accepted as a standard prescription. The concept of incremental dialysis has been established as a possible alternative for patients with preserved diuresis and end-stage renal failure in need of HD. The main problems related to prescription of incremental HD are an arbitrary use of infrequent regimens and the lack of clear standards for incorporating residual kidney function (RKF) in the assessment of HD dose. Several models have been proposed for prescription of incremental dialysis. The latest, the variable target model (VTM), gives more clinical weight to the RKF and allows less frequent HD treatments at lower RKF. Despite increasing evidence derived from observational studies to support the use of incremental HD, RCTs are lacking and, therefore, urgently needed.

Methods/Design:

The Department of Nephrology, Dialysis and Transplantation of the Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria Consorziale Policlinico, Bari, Italy and the EUDIAL Working Group of the European Renal Association - European Dialysis Transplant Association (ERA-EDTA) are starting a randomized clinical trial (RCT) in incident HD patients, whose name is ""REAL LIFE"", by using the acronym of its whole definition: RandomizEd clinicAL triaL on the effIcacy and saFety of incremental haEmodialysis. REAL LIFE is a pragmatic, prospective, multicentre, open label RCT, investigator-initiated, comparing the intervention arm (incremental HD) with the control arm (standard 3HD/wk). The trial, originally conceived by experts at the Division of Nephrology of the Miulli General Hospital, Acquaviva delle Fonti, Italy, consists in starting the HD treatment adopting the new incremental approach guided by the VTM. The primary outcome is the survival of kidney function, with the event defined as urinary output (UO) ≤ 100 mL/day, confirmed by a further collection after 2 weeks to exclude temporary illness.

Discussion: REAL LIFE will enable the investigators to know with the highest level of scientific evidence the safety and efficacy of an incremental approach to the start of HD treatment.","NO","End Stage Renal Disease on Dialysis","PROCEDURE: Incremental hemodialysis|PROCEDURE: Conventional hemodialysis","Number of participants whose kidney function remains >600 ml, The survival of kidney function is defined as a time to the event (anuria): the anuria is defined as urinary output (UO) ≤ 200 mL/day, confirmed by a further collection after 2 weeks to exclude temporary illness, 24 months","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,116,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT","2021-05-10","2024-11-30","2024-11-30","2020-04-24","","2022-05-20","Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria Consorziale Policlinico, Bari, 70124, Italy","procedure"

Through applying pressure on the specific acupoints based on TCM theory, acupressure could promote relaxation and wellness, balance yin-yang and treat diseases.

The PI has been using acupressure to treat various diseases in the clinics of the School of Chinese Medicine, HKU. Acupressure has demonstrated significant efficacy in treating geriatric diseases, obstetric diseases, pediatric diseases, rheumatoid arthritis and various painful symptoms. When applying acupressure on the Head- Neck - Shoulder area, it could also help to improve insomnia, reduce pain, and regulate the mood of the patients.

""Frailty"" is a geriatric syndrome of growing importance in the medical field. Prevalence of frailty increases with age. As our life expectancy increase, there will be more elderly suffered from frailty in the later stage of their life. Although there is still a lack of universally accepted clinical definition for frailty, the syndrome is now commonly understood as decreased reserves in multiple systems, and lowered resilience to negative stress. Frailty could be initiated by single or multiple conditions including malnutrition, chronic diseases, lack of exercise, stress and physiological or social changes caused by aging. Its manifestation includes sarcopenia, anorexia, energy reduction, dysfunctional neuroendocrine system and a pro-inflammatory state. Frailty could affect the emotional state of the elderly, meanwhile, positive affect is protective against the functional and physical decline associated with frailty.\[1\] There is limited treatment or medication for frailty. The investigators believe that acupressure could be a possible non invasive means to improve the general health conditions, including the emotional conditions of the frail elderly. In the past 2 years, the school of Chinese Medicine has been promoting acupressure as a health maintenance technique to the elderly, mostly frail elderly living in the community dwelling through seminars. It is in our interest to run a prospective research to further understand the efficacy of acupressure in a wider range of frail elderly. The investigators would like to use a well-designed pragmatic randomized controlled trial (PRCT) to investigate if acupressure could help the frail elderly to improve their general quality of life.","NO","Impaired","OTHER: acupressure","Elderlies' Quality of Life, Questionnaires:

Reduced antibiotic prescribing for outpatients is paralleled by a decrease in antibiotic resistance rates.

In a recent pragmatic trial, the investigators found only promising yet not very conclusive results as those were present only in some groups. This nationwide antibiotic stewardship program with routine feedback on antibiotic prescribing was not associated with an overall change in antibiotic use. In older children, adolescents, and younger adults fewer antibiotics were prescribed, but not consistently over the entire intervention period.

Hence, the investigators now aim to evaluate a better-tailored program to obtain a better understanding of the effects on patient-relevant outcomes, antibiotic resistance, and the underlying mechanisms leading to different effects in certain subgroups of patients.

The investigators plan to evaluate a nationwide antibiotic stewardship program combining routine prescription feedback with the provision of physician and patient education material for primary care physicians in Switzerland. The project is conducted within the framework of the National Program on antimicrobial resistance by the Swiss National Science Foundation.

Sixty percent of these older adults (\> 65 years) will return to their homes after a stroke and will require ongoing rehabilitation. About 92% of older adults have two or more chronic conditions. These patients often require services from a number of providers in a number of settings and are therefore, susceptible to fragmented health care when transitioning from hospital to home. New interventions are needed to improve the quality of care as patients move from hospital to home after a stroke. The proposed research project will examine the impact of a new intervention on patient/caregiver health, patient/caregiver and provider experience and costs, compared to usual health care services. The new intervention will be coordinated by a system navigator and consists of four core components: 1) development of a comprehensive discharge plan, 2) up to 6 home visits (supported by phone calls) by an interprofessional outpatient team, 3) monthly case conferences including the interprofessional care team who will discuss and focus on the patient's goals and care needs, and 4) linkages to other healthcare and community services.

National food, nutrition, and health policies and programs have positioned low-fat milk as the preferred caloric replacement strategy for SSBs. This strategy derives from evidence that replacement of SSBs with low-fat milk is associated with reductions in weight and incident diabetes in prospective cohort studies and reduces liver fat (an important early metabolic lesion linking obesity to diabetes), as well as triglycerides and blood pressure in randomized trials. Whether these benefits hold for soy milk alternatives is unclear. There is an urgent need for studies to clarify the benefits of soy milk as an alternative to cow's milk. Our overarching aim is to produce high-quality clinical evidence that informs the use of soy as a ""public health intervention"" for addressing the dual epidemics of obesity and diabetes and overall metabolic health. To achieve this aim, we propose to conduct the Soy Treatment Evaluation for Metabolic health (STEM) trial, a large, pragmatic, randomized controlled trial to assess the effect of using 2% soy milk (soy protein vehicle) versus 2% cow's milk (casein and whey vehicle matched for protein and volume) as a ""public health intervention"" to replace SSBs on liver fat and key cardiometabolic mediators/indicators in an at risk population.","NO","Metabolic Syndrome|Overweight and Obesity|PreDiabetes|Diabetes|Healthy Obesity, Metabolically|Overweight|Obesity|Dysglycemia|Cardiovascular Diseases|Heart Disease Risk Factors|Hypertension|Dyslipidemias","OTHER: Soy Milk|OTHER: Cow's Milk|OTHER: Sugar Sweetened Beverages","Liver fat, intra-hepatocellular lipid (IHCL) by 1H-MRS measured at weeks 0 and 24, End value at week 24","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,186,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE (INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: PREVENTION","2021-11-02","2024-09-30","2025-03-30","2022-01-13","","2023-09-13","Clinical Nutrition and Risk Factor Modification Centre, St. Michael's Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, M5C 2T2, Canada","other"

"133","NCT04575831","Exercise, Nutrition, and Palliative Care in Advanced Lung Cancer (ENPAL)","COMPLETED","Background: Evidence supports exercise and nutrition as beneficial for enhancing QOL in earlier stages of lung cancer; however, there is minimal research of either intervention - and none with combined interventions - in advanced lung cancer patients. In addition to a multimodal intervention approach that includes nutrition and exercise, consideration of advanced cancer care symptom management is crucial for optimizing the potential benefits of either intervention.

Objectives: Primary outcome measure of this study is feasibility, including recruitment (% who participate from those eligible), attendance (weekly group class), assessment completion, safety (adverse event reporting), attrition rates, and qualitative themes generated from one-on-one participant interviews. The secondary outcome to be measured is the impact of the intervention on PROs, including QOL, fatigue and symptom burden, as well as self-reported physical activity levels and physical function assessed in-person.

Methods: The proposed exercise intervention will include a centre-based group exercise program plus home-based exercises, and behaviour change support for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, classified as stage III or IV with self-reported symptom burden. Eligible participants must be cleared by the health care professionals (HCP) to engage in mild to moderate levels of physical activity (PA). Using a prospective, mixed-methods design (supported by the Medical Research Council guidance for the evaluation of complex interventions), the quantitative component of this pilot study will measure feasibility and exploratory outcome measures, with an embedded qualitative component to examine participant perspectives about study tolerability/feasibility of the intervention. A subset of participants and instructors will be recruited for qualitative interviews using purposive sampling to achieve maximum variation based on factors that may lead to different viewpoints (e.g., age, gender, lung cancer type/stage, treatment).

Relevance: The proposed work will inform the design of a future pragmatic trial for this population.

Tenotomy and tenodesis have been shown to produce favourable and comparable results in treating LHB lesions, but a controversy still exists regarding the treatment of choice. Some suggest that tenotomy should be reserved for older, low-demand patients, while tenodesis should be performed in younger patients and those who engage in heavy labor. Proponents of tenotomy suggest that this is a technically easy procedure that leads to easy rehabilitation and fast return to activity with a low complication and reoperation rate. However, those who support LHB tenodesis list good preservation of elbow flexion and supination strength, improvement of functional scores, elimination of pain, and avoidance of cosmetic deformity as benefits of the procedure. Alternatively, the LHB can be maintained in the joint without tenodesis or tenotomy.

"141","NCT02961582","Effectiveness and Cost-effectiveness of Sacral Neuromodulation in Patients With Idiopathic Slow-transit Constipation","COMPLETED","Rationale: Previous reviews showed that the evidence regarding the effectiveness of sacral neuromodulation (SNM) in patients with therapy-resistant, idiopathic (slow-transit) constipation is of suboptimal quality. Furthermore, there is no estimate of costs and cost-effectiveness in this patient group.

Objective: The main objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of SNM compared to personalized conservative treatment (PCT), in patients with idiopathic slow-transit constipation who are refractory to conservative treatment. The secondary objectives are assessing the 1) costs, 2) cost-effectiveness and 3) budget-impact of SNM compared to PCT.

Hypothesis: Based on previous research we hypothesize that SNM will be more effective than PCT in terms of a significantly higher proportion of patients having treatment success at 6 months.

Study design: An open-label pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT) combined with a prospective cohort study.

Study population: Adolescent (14-17 years) and adult (18-80 years) patients with idiopathic slow-transit constipation refractory to conservative treatment.

Intervention: The intervention is SNM, a minimally invasive surgical procedure consisting of two phases. In the screening phase an electrode is inserted near the third sacral nerve and connected to an external stimulator. If the screening phase is successful (average defecation frequency (DF) ≥3 a week), the electrode is connected to a pacemaker that is implanted in the buttocks of the patient. If not successful, patients receive conservative treatment. The control intervention is PCT. This is the best and least invasive alternative to SNM. PCT consists of medication and/or retrograde colonic irrigation.

Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary outcome is success at 6 months, defined as an average DF of ≥3 a week according to a 3-week defecation diary. Secondary outcomes are straining, sense of incomplete evacuation, constipation severity, fatigue, constipation specific and generic (health-related) quality of life ((HR)QOL), and costs at 6 months.

However, drug treatment only succeed in restoring blood flow in a minority of people with clots in the larger arteries (10-25% depending on the size of the blood vessel) and these people also have the most severe strokes and highest risk of death or dependence as a result of the stroke. Current best treatment is therefore least effective in the group with the most severe strokes. Devices that can be fed through the blood vessels to either remove or break up the blood clot in the brain vessels can open this type of large artery blockage. However, using these devices is a highly skilled procedure and it takes some time both to set up the necessary facilities (including anaesthetic, nurses and medical support) and to reach the blockage. The extra time that is required to use these devices may mean that brain tissue is already irreversibly damaged. If so, then an individual patient cannot benefit and indeed may be harmed by opening the artery. There are no completed clinical trials comparing the outcome in people treated with standard stroke treatment and those treated with devices.

The logistics and costs of navigating cancer treatments have become a principal contributor to patients' reduced quality of life. It is therefore important to reduce the burden of cancer in the lives of patients and their caregivers, and a vital aspect of this involves moving beyond traditional hospital and clinic-based care and evaluate innovative care delivery models with virtual capabilities.

Despite availability of effective treatment, tuberculosis (TB) remains an important cause of mortality with 1.3 million lives lost globally to TB in 2012. The greatest proportion of new TB cases occurs in Africa and over 95% of TB deaths occur in low income countries (LICs). In response to the combined high TB burden and severe healthcare worker shortages in these settings, outpatient TB care is among the tasks commonly shifted to LHWs.

LHWs are community members who have received some training but are not healthcare professionals. Randomised trials show LHWs improve access to basic health services and TB treatment outcomes, however, insufficient training and supervision are recognized barriers to their effectiveness.

The investigators' goal is to improve TB care provided by LHWs in Malawi by implementing and evaluating a knowledge translation (KT) strategy designed to facilitate incorporation of evidence into LHW practice.

"170","NCT03779789","Vortioxetine in the Elderly vs. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs): a Pragmatic Assessment","COMPLETED","Background. Depression is a highly frequent condition in the elderly, with a huge impact on quality of life, life expectancy, and medical outcomes. SSRIs are commonly prescribed in elderly depressed patients and, although generally safe, they may be associated with tolerability issues. Based on available studies, vortioxetine is likely to have a promising tolerability profile in the elderly, as it does not adversely affect psychomotor or cognitive performance, wakefulness, body weight, and electrocardiogram parameters.

Objectives. Assessing the comparative tolerability, safety and efficacy of vortioxetine compared with the SSRIs as a group (including sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram, paroxetine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine) in elderly patients affected by major depression. The primary outcome will be the withdrawal rate due to adverse events.

Methods. This is a pragmatic, multicenter, open-label, parallel-group, superiority, randomized trial. Twelve Italian Community Psychiatric Services will consecutively enrol elderly patients suffering from an episode of major depression who get in contact over a period of 12 months. By employing the web-based application RedCap, doctors will be able to randomize patients to vortioxetine or one of the SSRIs, chosen on the basis of clinical judgment, and to collect basic socio-demographic and clinical data. Trained and blinded assessors will administer five validated rating scales: Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Antidepressant Side-Effect Checklist (ASEC), EuroQual 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D), Charlson Age-Comorbidity Index (CACI), and Short Blessed Test (SBT). Patients will be assessed after 1, 3 and 6 months.

Expected results. On the basis of current literature, the investigators hypothesize vortioxetine to be superior to SSRIs as a group in terms of tolerability. As vortioxetine is expected to reduce the withdrawal rates due to adverse events of about 12% compared to SSRIs, and assuming that about 23% of the participants could be lost within 6 months, the investigators aim to enrol 358 patients (179 in each group).","NO","Major Depressive Disorder","DRUG: Vortioxetine|DRUG: Sertraline|DRUG: citalopram|DRUG: Escitalopram|DRUG: Paroxetine|DRUG: Fluoxetine|DRUG: Fluvoxamine","Number of participants withdrawing from treatment due to adverse events (tolerability), Participants withdrawing from allocated treatment due to adverse events on the number of randomized patients., 6 months","ALL","OLDER_ADULT","PHASE4",362,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT","2019-02-01","2023-02-28","2023-02-28","2018-12-19","","2023-05-19","Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Mater Domini, Università Magna Grecia, Catanzaro, Italy|Sapienza Università di Roma, Dipartimento di Neurologia e Psichiatria, Roma, Italy|Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Verona, Verona, 37134, Italy","drug"
"171","NCT04804527","Intensified In-hospital Physiotherapy for Patients After Hip Fracture Surgery.","COMPLETED","Regaining basis mobility after a hip fracture surgery is an important in-hospital rehabilitation goal because patients who have regained basis mobility at pre-fracture level at discharge have lower 30-day mortality and readmission rate and are more likely to be discharged to their own home. However, at discharge only half of the patients have regained their pre-fracture basis mobility level.

Intensified acute in-hospital physiotherapy (e.g. more than once daily) highlighting weight-bearing activities and ambulation could have a positive effect on the proportion of patients who regain their pre-facture basic mobility at discharge. However, data from daily clinical practice suggest that only half of the patients are able to complete physiotherapy on the first postoperative day and that fatigue, hip fracture-related pain and habitual cognitive status are the most frequent reasons for not completing planned physiotherapy (once daily) during the first three postoperative days. Thus to undertake an RCT investigating the effect of intensified acute in-hospital physiotherapy i.e. two daily sessions of physiotherapy compared to usual care i.e. one daily session, on regained pre-facture basic mobility at discharge in patients with hip fracture raises important practical concerns regarding e.g. completion rate of planned physiotherapy. The potential positive effects of intensified physiotherapy will be hampered if too many patients are unable to complete planned physiotherapy e.g. because of fatigue or pain. Feasibility studies ask whether something can be done and are preliminary studies conducted specifically for the purposes of establishing whether or not a full trial will be feasible to conduct. Thus, the main aim of the trial is to assess the feasibility of conducting a definitive pragmatic RCT in terms of implementation, practicality and acceptability of intensified acute in-hospital physiotherapy i.e. two daily sessions of physiotherapy highlighting weight-bearing activities and ambulation on weekdays among patients with hip fracture.

"172","NCT06108427","REnin-guided TherApy With MinEralocorticoid Receptor Antagonists in Primary Aldosteronism - Feasibility Study","NOT_YET_RECRUITING","High blood pressure, or hypertension, can be caused by a condition called Primary Aldosteronism (PA), where the body produces too much of a hormone called aldosterone. People with PA have a higher risk of heart problems compared to those with regular high blood pressure. To treat PA, some patients need to take medicine called mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) for the rest of their lives. While treatment with MRA is effective, it can have side effects like high levels of potassium in the blood, breast enlargement in men, menstrual problems in women, and reduced sex drive. Finding the right dose of MRA for each patient can be tricky.

Recent observations suggest that when a hormone called renin goes up during MRA treatment, it might be a good sign. This is because renin is higher when the action of aldosterone is well blocked. But it's not certain if this happens because of the patient's unique characteristics or if it can truly be a way to know if the treatment is working.

This study aims to find out if guiding MRA treatment with renin levels leads to more patients having unsuppressed renin levels compared to the standard of care.

This is a multicentric pragmatic clinical trial. Patients with a new diagnosis of PA and low renin levels will be asked if there are willing to participate. Those with recent use of MRA, known MRA intolerance, severe kidney problems, or have high potassium levels will not be able to participate.

Participants will be randomized into two groups: one group will have their MRA treatment adjusted based on renin levels (the ""renin-guided"" group), and the other group won't have renin levels checked during treatment (the ""renin-blinded"" group). Both groups will aim to have their blood pressure under control and potassium levels in the normal range.

The main outcome is the proportion in each group with unsuppressed renin levels after 12 months. Other outcomes will be tested, such as changes in renin levels, how well the treatment works, and any safety concerns (like potassium levels, kidney function, side effects, and blood pressure changes). Different groups of patients will also be looked at separately, like men and women, different ages, races, and initial renin levels, to see if the approach works better for some people.

This study will help find a safe and effective way to treat PA with MRA. Choosing the right dose of MRA is important to adequately block aldosterone but also to avoid side effects.","NO","Primary Aldosteronism","OTHER: Renin measurements","Proportion of participants with unsuppressed renin, Proportion of participants with plasma renin concentration \>15 mIU/L or \>10 ng/L, or plasma renin activity \>1 ng/mL/h, 12 months","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,58,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT","2024-03","2025-12","2025-12","2023-10-31","","2024-02-01","Hôpital du Sacré-Coeur de Montréal, Montréal, Quebec, H4J1C5, Canada","other"

Trauma accounts for nearly 10% of the global burden of disease. Several trauma life support programs aim to improve trauma outcomes. There is no evidence from controlled trials to show the effect of these programs on patient outcomes. We describe the protocol of a pilot study that aims to assess the feasibility of conducting a cluster randomised controlled trial comparing Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) and Primary Trauma Care (PTC) with standard care.

Methods and analysis:

We will pilot a pragmatic three-armed parallel, cluster randomised, controlled trial in India, where neither of these programs are routinely taught. We will recruit tertiary hospitals and include trauma patients and residents managing these patients. Two hospitals will be randomised to ATLS, two to PTC, and two to standard care. The primary outcome will be all cause mortality at 30 days from the time of arrival to the emergency department. Our secondary outcomes will include patient, provider, and process measures. All outcomes except time to event outcomes will be measured both as final values as well as change from baseline. We will compare outcomes in three combinations of trial arms: ATLS versus PTC, ATLS versus standard care, and PTC versus standard care using absolute and relative differences along with associated confidence intervals. We will conduct subgroup analyses across the clinical subgroups men, women, blunt multisystem trauma, penetrating trauma, shock, severe traumatic brain injury, and elderly. In parallel to the pilot study we will conduct community consultations to inform the planning of the full-scale trial.","NO","Trauma Injury","OTHER: Trauma life support training","All cause mortality within 30 days from the time of arrival to the emergency department, 30 days","ALL","CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,306,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT","2022-05-23","2023-02-01","2023-02-01","2022-06-14","","2022-11-09","Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education & Research, Chandigarh, India|Medica Superspecialty Hospital, Kolkata, India|Medical College, Kolkata, India|Sir Nil Ratan Sircar Medical College & Hospital, Kolkata, India|HBT Medical College And Dr. R N Cooper Municipal General Hospital, Mumbai, India|King Edward Memorial Seth G.

TNBC is diagnosed in 15-20% of breast cancer cases and tends to occur in younger women and have biologically more aggressive high grade disease. Clinically, patients with TNBC have a poorer prognosis compared to patients diagnosed with other breast cancer subtypes. Because of the aggressive phenotype and due to observations that systemic chemotherapy offers significantly higher benefit in ER negative disease, current treatment guidelines from provincial and other organizations recommend that patients receive adjuvant systemic chemotherapy for any TNBC greater than 0.5 cm in greatest diameter or node positive independent of primary tumor size.

Currently, there is no world-wide standard recommended chemotherapy regimen for the management of TNBC in the neoadjuvant/adjuvant setting, with treatments varying from region and institution.

The study design is a pragmatic, multicenter, stepped wedge cluster randomized trial, enrolling at five sites over a 3-year period, divided into six time periods of six months. Prior to the study, each site will be randomized to their position within the design. One site will cross to the intervention period (i.e. succinylcholine as default neuromuscular blocker) every six months from the 2nd to 6th time period. Cluster order will be determined by computer-based randomization. To begin, each site will be exposed to control conditions; by the end of the study, each site will be exposed to intervention conditions.

Patients in the control phase will receive usual care, and this phase will be entirely observational. After six months, a site will enter a 2-month transition phase. In this phase, the investigators will implement the intervention, similar to how they have implemented other ED-based interventions for mechanically ventilated patients. The investigators will engage and educate ED clinicians on the importance of AWP prevention and the study objectives. The intervention framework relies on the use of ""nudges"", without restricting choice. The use of neuromuscular blockers (i.e. ""paralytic"" medications) is already part of routine care in the ED in order to facilitate endotracheal intubation and initiation of mechanical ventilation for patients with acute respiratory failure. The two most common neuromuscular blockers used in the ED are succinylcholine and rocuronium. The preliminary data show a strong association between rocuronium (a longer-acting neuromuscular blocker) use and AWP. Therefore, this study aims to improve care by educating caregivers on AWP and the use of the neuromuscular blockers, which are already routinely used, and studying that process in a rigorous fashion. The default neuromuscular blocker in the intervention phase will be succinylcholine. Succinylcholine will be the default over rocuronium because: 1) it has safely been the default neuromuscular blocker of choice in the ED for \>40 years ; 2) its 5-minute duration of action greatly reduces AWP risk; 3) the preliminary data regarding an increased risk of AWP with rocuronium and 4) ED rocuronium use has increased despite no patient-centered studies showing benefit over succinylcholine. Passive alerts (i.e. graphics, pocket cards) will also be strategically placed in the ED, and active alerts will be used as reminders before every nursing shift (i.e. ""the huddle"").

• How effective is a hybrid model of CR for people with cardiovascular disease living in a francophone minority community compared to a centre-based model of CR in terms of leading to maintenance of gains (physical activity level, functional capacity, mental health, quality of life) six months after CR? Participants will undergo a 12-week hybrid cardiac rehabilitation program. For the first six weeks, patients will be required to attend the hospital twice a week. After that, there will be a gradual increase in home sessions for the remaining six weeks. When a patient has a home session, health professionals will follow up with a weekly phone call.

"182","NCT03455608","PRO-ACTIVE: Prophylactic Swallow Intervention for Patients Receiving Radiotherapy for Head and Neck Cancer","ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING","Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) is a common and potentially life-threatening toxicity of radiotherapy (RT) for patients with head and neck cancer (HNC). HNC survivors have a 20-24 percent lifetime risk of pneumonia after RT, which is associated with a 42 percent excess risk of death in survivorship. Moreover, dysphagia predisposes individuals to malnutrition, and at least half of HNC patients require feeding tubes during RT.

Patients are commonly referred for swallowing therapy with a speech pathologist. Some patients receive early intervention, before a swallowing problem begins-PRO-ACTIVE therapy. Other patients are monitored and prescribed dysphagia interventions only if and when a swallowing problem occurs-RE-ACTIVE therapy. Thus, REACTIVE therapy aims to reverse an already impaired swallowing ability, whereas PRO-ACTIVE therapy aims to prevent or reduce severity of dysphagia. These two broad categories of therapy represent the most common types of intervention offered to HNC patients across North America. Although there is single-institution evidence to support each practice, it is yet unknown which is most effective.

To address this gap, the primary aim of this international, multi-site 3-arm pragmatic randomized clinical trial is to compare the effectiveness of PRO-ACTIVE (high and low intensity) versus RE-ACTIVE swallowing therapy among 952 patients with HNC planning to undergo RT, using duration of feeding tube dependence after RT as the primary outcome.

Informal care is one of the most important sources of care for dependent elderly people. The Partner in Balance (PIB) intervention aims to prepare and support informal caregivers for their caregiving tasks. Long-term cost-effectiveness evidence is required to support reimbursement decision-making on this PIB program. The investigators hypothesize that 1) caregiver self-efficacy in intervention arm PiB is higher compared to the control arm of usual care; 2) care costs of participants in intervention arm are lower compared to the control arm of usual care.

Objectives:

The investigators aim to answer the following research questions:

* What is the effect of PiB on caregiver self-efficacy compared to usual care?
* What is the effect of PiB on caregiver and person with dementia total care costs compared to usual care?
* What is the incremental cost-utility ratio of PiB compared to usual care?
* What is the annual budget impact of PiB compared to usual care?

Any patient needing this support requires drugs to keep them sleepy, or ""sedated"" to be comfortable on this machine. Sedation is made possible by using drugs given through a vein. Unfortunately, these drugs are in short supply worldwide due to the high number of COVID-19 patients needing these machines.

Another way to provide sleep is by using gases that are breathed in. These are used every day in operating rooms to perform surgery. These gases, also called ""inhaled agents"" can also be used in intensive care units and may have several important benefits for patients and the hospital. Research shows they may reduce swelling in the lung and increase oxygen levels, which allows patients to recover faster and reduce the time spent on a breathing machine. In turn, this allows the breathing machine to be used again for the next sick patient. These drugs may also increase the number of patients who live through their illness. Inhaled agents are widely available and their use could dramatically lesson the pressure on limited drug supplies.

This research is a study being carried out in a number of hospitals that will compare how well patients recover from these illnesses depending on which type of sedation drug they receive. The plan is to evaluate the number who survive, their time spent on a breathing machine and time in the hospital. This study may show immediate benefits and may provide a cost effective and practical solution to the current challenges caring for patients and the hospital space, equipment and drugs to the greatest benefit.

Taking into account that the definition of early stages through the criteria demarcated by the Colombian clinical practice guideline, where the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the indicator for stratification as follows: stage 1 people with a GFR less than or equal to 90 (ml (min / 1.73 m2), stage 2 people with GFR between 60-89 (ml (min / 1.73 m2), stage 3 people with GFR between 30-59 (ml (min / 1.73 m2)) and stage 4 people with GFR between 15-30 (ml (min / 1.73 m2) who attend kidney protection programs of the Renal Units in Colombia.

STUDY VARIABLES

Among the variables that are available for the present study are:

* Independent Variables: Sociodemographic characteristics, related to the disease or clinical condition and the CKD intervention.
* Dependent variables: Self-management behaviors, therapeutic adherence, and self-efficacy.

Within the mediating, shaping or confounding variables, the following are found according to what is established in the literature: age, gender, level of education, time of diagnosis and other comorbidities, which are initially considered independent variables and will be measured. In the study, for its management, strategies such as randomization will be used, the differences between the crude estimates of an association and those adjusted considering a confounding variable will be identified and its adjustment is responsible for at least 10% in the magnitude of the difference.

Aim 1) Among opioid naïve primary care patients with acute non-cancer pain, compare the effect of the provider-targeted behavioral interventions (opioid justification and provider comparison), individually and in combination, on initial opioid prescription, initial use of non-opioid management, and patient-reported pain and function.

Aim 2) Compare the effect of the 2 provider-targeted behavioral interventions, individually and in combination, on unsafe opioid prescribing and transition to chronic opioid therapy.

Aim 3) Assess provider satisfaction and experience with the provider-targeted behavioral interventions.

Hypotheses:

Aim 1, H1a: Compared with the guideline (usual care) alone, the addition of the opioid justification and provider comparison behavioral interventions will be associated with a decreased proportion of opioid prescription and increased proportion of non-opioid management at the initial outpatient visit for acute non-cancer pain.

Aim 1, H1b: Compared with usual care (guideline) alone, the addition of the opioid justification and provider comparison behavioral interventions will be associated with no difference in patient-reported pain, function, and satisfaction at 1, 6, and 12 months.

Aim 2, H2: Compared with the usual care (guideline), the addition of opioid justification and provider comparison behavioral interventions will be associated with a decreased proportion of patients receiving unsafe opioid therapy and a decreased proportion of patients transitioning to chronic opioid therapy.

A recent survey of practices regarding the management of IE in France showed that a switch from IV to oral antibiotics is feasible, when patients with left-sided Streptococcus-Enterococcus IE are stable after an initial course of IV antibiotic treatment, with or without valvular surgery.

These practices have not been associated with unfavourable outcome, while significantly reducing the duration and cost of hospitalization, the risk of nosocomial infection, and patients' discomfort.

There has been no randomized controlled trial (RCT) in the field of IE over the last 20 years; current guidelines are mostly based on expert advice, in vitro studies, animal experiments, or clinical studies performed before the 90's.

The RODEO 2 project is an unprecedented opportunity to bring back evidence-based medicine in the field of IE.

Within 90 days of discharge, about 30% of smokers have returned to daily smoking and almost 60% have relapsed by 1 year. Patients with CVD who resume smoking are more likely to experience new events (e.g. heart attack or stroke) or die. New approaches are required. A new type of cessation product is a plant-based medication called Cytisine. Cytisine is taken orally over 25 days and reduces the pleasurable sensations that smokers get from cigarettes and reduces withdrawal symptoms. The primary research question is whether or not it is feasible to conduct a large-scale trial of the effectiveness of this product compared to conventional nicotine replacement therapy in smokers who have failed to quit using conventional methods. To determine feasibility, a pilot study will be conducted of sixty smokers (30 men, 30 women) with CVD who have been treated for smoking cessation but have relapsed within 90 days of discharge. Participants will complete a baseline assessment and will be randomly assigned to either the combination nicotine replacement therapy group (patch plus lozenge) or cytisine group. Participants will be treated for 25 days and then will return to UOHI so adherence to treatment and smoking status can be assessed.

"245","NCT05906095","Pragmatic Trial to Increase Quality of Care in State Veterans Homes","ENROLLING_BY_INVITATION","Background: State Veterans Home nursing homes (SVHs) care for 51% of all Veterans receiving VA-funded nursing home care. SVHs cost VA $1.2 billion yearly in per diem payments. This critical system provides care to a population of over 20,000 vulnerable Veterans annually but has been little researched and is in urgent need of attention. In some SVHs, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in large numbers of preventable illnesses, hospitalizations, and even deaths. Congress, the Government Accountability Office, and the Secretary have all called for greater VA involvement in this system that lacks a national quality improvement infrastructure and lags behind VA on many quality measures, including falls. This study addresses SVHs' need to reduce high fall rates-55% of residents experience at least one fall per quarter-by implementing an effective, evidence-based program known as LOCK. In LOCK, staff (1) ""Learn from bright spots"" (focus on evidence of positive change); (2) ""Observe"" (collect data through systematic observation); (3) ""Collaborate in huddles"" (conduct frontline staff huddles); and (4) ""Keep it bite-size"" (limit activities to 5-15 minutes). The program avoids reliance on existing quality improvement infrastructures, can be easily integrated into frontline staff routines, and has demonstrated success in improving clinical outcomes, including reductions in falls.

Significance: This study provides the following. (1) Timely, evidence-based research support to improve care for SVHs' vulnerable population of aging Veterans. (2) Explicit integration of frontline staff expertise, ensuring interventions are practicable and successful. (3) Direct alignment with high-reliability principles-such as sensitivity to operations and deference to expertise-helping extend VA's high-reliability focus to SVHs.

Innovation and Impact: This study contributes the following. (1) Advances the science of how to intervene in settings that do not have a strong, centralized quality improvement focus through rigorous investigation of how and why an intervention works in SVHs. (2) Investigates sustainment of the investigators' intervention-the extent to which it becomes part of usual care-for up to 12 months after completion of each step of the investigators' wedge-based design. (3) Provides timely, systematic investigation of a new area for VA research, gathering information on VA researcher-SVH partnerships to support future collaborations.

Specific Aims: Aim 1: Investigate the effectiveness of the LOCK program at improving the investigators' primary outcome of any resident fall. This study will also investigate other resident clinical outcomes (mobility, medication changes, restraint and alarm use) and work-process outcomes for staff (job satisfaction, work engagement, burnout). This study will use both primary and secondary data collection. Aim 2: Evaluate the LOCK program's implementation. This study will use the replicating effective programs framework and multi-modal implementation facilitation strategies to implement the program. This study will use mixed methods to evaluate the program's reach, adoption, and implementation. Aim 3: Assess the extent of program sustainment. Mixed methods will enable examination of intervention sustainment at 3, 6, and 12 months post intervention and sustainment variability among sites.

Methodology: This is a 4-year hybrid (Type 2) effectiveness-implementation study. It uses a pragmatic stepped-wedge randomized trial design and employs relational coordination theory and the RE-AIM framework to guide implementation and evaluation.

Next Steps: This study (1) directly improves care for aging Veterans, (2) advances understanding of how to intervene in settings lacking quality improvement infrastructure, and (3) contributes knowledge about intervention sustainment. This study also addresses VA's Research Lifecycle stages of (a) scale up and spread and (b) sustainment. Findings may help improve care in other settings (e.g., inpatient mental health and domiciliary programs).","NO","Long-Term Care|Accidental Falls","BEHAVIORAL: LOCK Falls Program","Rate of falls, The investigators' primary outcome will be measured using the MDS indicator of ""any falls since admission/entry or reentry or prior assessment"" for long-stay residents.

Patient navigation is a strategy for guiding individuals through complex health systems, and the investigators hypothesize that this may be a promising approach for helping homeless-experienced people overcome their unique barriers to obtaining LCS.

The investigators will aim to recruit 300 people to participate in this research study; 100 will be randomly assigned to arm 1 (usual care) and 200 will be randomly assigned to arm 2 (patient navigation). Randomization of participants will be stratified by smoking status, housing status, clinical site, and whether they have previously discussed LCS with their primary care provider (PCP) to ensure balance between study groups on these variables. People assigned to the usual care arm will be referred back to their PCP for further management. People assigned to the patient navigation arm will be given the chance to work with a LCS navigator. The navigator will assist participants and their PCPs with all aspects of the LCS process in addition to offering brief tobacco counseling for current smokers.

The primary aim of the trial is to determine-among homeless-experienced people who are eligible for LCS-the effect of patient navigation on 1) LCS LDCT completion at 6 months post-enrollment and 2) LCS LDCT completion at 6 months with diagnostic follow-up of abnormal results within 1 month of the recommended time frame. Study outcomes will be assessed by examining participant health records.

"253","NCT02556957","CHWs, mHealth, and Combination HIV Prevention","COMPLETED","Kasensero, a fishing community on Lake Victoria in Uganda, is a representative HIV ""hotspot"" with extremely high HIV prevalence (44.3%) and incidence (\~3.9/100py), yet low HIV service utilization. Hotspots such as Kasensero may seed and sustain HIV in general populations, compromising national and regional HIV control efforts. PEPFAR, UNAIDS, and WHO have recognized the urgent need to target hotspots with enhanced HIV treatment and prevention efforts. However, evidence on low-cost, comprehensive, and effective HIV control strategies for hotspots is limited and is thus a priority need for the field.

The investigators propose an implementation science, cluster-randomized, controlled trial in Kasensero to evaluate the impact on HIV service uptake and HIV incidence of CHWs promoting combination HIV prevention (CHP) services supported by mobile health technologies (mHealth). CHP is the implementation of multiple, evidence-based HIV prevention services (HIV testing and counseling, antiretroviral therapy, medical male circumcision, and behavior change) to maximize population-level impact on HIV incidence. For CHP to substantively decrease HIV incidence, most community members must be assessed for risk factors and current CHP utilization, then triaged, motivated, linked, and, if HIV-infected, retained in care. The proposed intervention will use low-cost CHWs leveraging mHealth decision support and counseling tools to promote CHP along this entire continuum of HIV service utilization. The hypotheses for this implementation science research are that residents in clusters receiving the implementation intervention will have improved CHP service uptake and decreased Population Prevalence of Viremia (PPDV) compared to controls receiving standard of care.

The intervention will be evaluated through a pragmatic, cluster-randomized trial nested within a large, ongoing population-based cohort study of HIV, the Rakai Community Cohort Study (RCCS). Intervention arm participants will be visited in their place of residence by CHWs trained to evaluate and triage participants into risk categories, provide tailored CHP health counseling, linkage, and adherence support, all supported by a mHealth decision support tool. The primary outcomes will be CHP service coverage and PPDV. Other outcomes will be HIV incidence, population viral load, implementation measures, retention, virologic suppression, and sexual behaviors.

Complimentary mixed methods (quantitative, qualitative, and cost) evaluations of the trial will be conducted to evaluate implementation processes, facilitators, and barriers to inform study results and future program uptake. Focus groups and in-depth interviews will be conducted during and after the follow-up period and synthesized with quantitative data. Intervention costs will be prospectively measured to provide information on program affordability.

Through this study, a novel, low-cost, and scalable implementation intervention to improve CHP uptake will be evaluated in an HIV ""hotspot"" critical to controlling the HIV epidemic.

Blood pressure lowering pills reduce this risk - but perhaps not optimally. A Spanish study suggests that using blood pressure pills at bedtime, instead of in the morning (when they are most commonly used), reduces death, heart attack, and stroke by more than 50%. If true, a switch to bedtime prescribing would have more impact on the health of those with high blood pressure than whether high blood pressure is treated at all.

BedMed, a community-based Canadian primary care trial, is already running and looking both to validate the findings of this Spanish study and to determine whether there might be unrecognized harms of bedtime use (such as more falls and fractures as a result of lower overnight blood pressure). One very important population that is likely to be more sensitive to the effects of medications, and almost always excluded from randomized trials, are the frail elderly (such as those who are resident in nursing homes). In order to have the greatest information about the safety and effectiveness of bedtime blood pressure medications, the BedMed team is additionally conducting a similar trial to BedMed in nursing homes (""BedMed-Frail"" - the subject of this trial registration) to determine whether the risks and benefits of bedtime prescribing differ in this highly understudied population.

Basics of the trial: When patients are admitted to nursing homes, neither they nor their physicians are consulted about the timing of blood pressure medication. Unless explicitly stated to be otherwise, blood pressure pills are instead largely arbitrarily assigned for morning use by default. Given there is evidence that bedtime administration may be safer, the nursing homes participating in BedMed-Frail will have each hypertensive resident randomized to either continue with morning blood pressure medication use, as is their norm, or to have their facility's pharmacist gradually switch each residents blood pressure pills to bedtime. Over a period of roughly 3 years, health outcomes in these facilities will be tracked using routinely collected electronic health data to determine differences in things like hospitalization, death, or hip fractures - and at the end of the study the investigators hope to determine whether or not the recommendations for blood pressure medication timing in frail older adults should differ from those for the general population.","NO","Hypertension|Dementia","OTHER: Bedtime administration of the participant's pre-existing antihypertensive medications","Composite of Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events, Composite of all-cause death and hospital admission or emergency room visit for acute coronary syndrome / myocardial infarction, heart failure, or stroke - as recorded in governmental health claims databases, 3 years (Estimate Only - study continues until 368 participants have experienced primary outcome events)","ALL","CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,875,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: PREVENTION","2020-05-14","2024-03","2024-03","2019-08-13","","2024-02-05","Multiple Alberta Long Term Care Facilities, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada","other"
"255","NCT05371548","Smart About Meds (SAM) RCT","RECRUITING","Introduction:

Almost half of patients discharged from hospital are re-admitted or return to the emergency department (ED) within 90 days. Patient nonadherence to medication changes during hospitalization and the use of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) both contribute to the risk of adverse events post-discharge. Smart About Meds (SAM) is a patient-centered mobile application designed to target medication nonadherence and PIMs use. This protocol describes a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the effectiveness of SAM.

Methods \& Analysis:

A pragmatic, stratified RCT will be conducted among 3,200 patients discharged from internal medicine, cardiac care, and hospitalist units of the Royal Victoria Hospital, Montreal General Hospital, and Lachine Hospital. At discharge, patients will be randomized 1:1 to usual care or the SAM intervention. SAM integrates novel user-centered features (e.g. continuously updated medication list with pill images, side-effect checker, interaction checker) with pharmacist monitoring to tackle post-discharge nonadherence to new medication regimens. SAM also notifies patients of PIMS in their regimen, with advice to discuss with their physician.

Following discharge, patients will be followed for 90 days, during which the occurrence of the composite outcome of ED visits, hospital readmissions, or death will be measured. Secondary outcomes will include nonadherence to medication changes, defined as failure to fill a new prescription, filling a modified prescription at the incorrect dose, or filling discontinued medications, as well as patient empowerment and health-related quality of life.

An intention-to-treat analysis will evaluate the effectiveness of SAM. Multivariable logistic regression will estimate differences between treatment groups in the proportion of patients nonadherent to at least one medication change. With a sample size of 3,200, there will be 80% power to detect a 5% absolute reduction in this outcome. Two-way interaction terms will test hypothesized modifiers of SAM's effectiveness, including hospital, unit, age, sex, gender and comorbidity burden. Binary and continuous secondary outcomes will be assessed using multivariable logistic and linear regression, respectively.","NO","Medication Adherence","DEVICE: SAM mobile application","ED visits, hospital readmissions, and deaths (composite), This is a composite, binary outcome of having experienced an ED visit, hospital readmission, or death in the 90 days post-discharge.

By the end of the grant period in July 2013, the project team had successfully developed and initially validated eight scales measuring the most common GI symptoms.

Afterwards, Dr. Spiegel's PROMIS team joined forces with the UCLA Computing Technology Research Laboratory (CTRL) and the University of Michigan Center for Healthcare Communication Research to develop the Automated Evaluation of Gastrointestinal Symptoms (AEGIS) algorithm which is delivered via My GI Health, an open--source Internet based patient-provider portal (P3) designed to enhance the delivery of GI health care (www.MyGIHealth.org). Through My GI Health and AEGIS, patients are able to complete PROMIS GI symptom measures and provide additional information about their GI symptoms and histories from computers, tablets or smart phones without the constraints of physical locale. This information is condensed into a GI PROMIS scores report and initial GI history that patients' providers can review prior to or concurrent with seeing the patient. The report, which can be incorporated into the electronic health record (EHR), helps busy clinicians to quickly understand the patient's complaints, document their symptoms and GI history, and leaves more time for conversation with the patient.

Beyond focusing their interaction, My GI Health also supports both the clinician and patient with an individualized ""educational prescription"" which guides the patient through a library of multi-media educational materials on GI symptoms, conditions, and treatments also contained within the website. The prescription is initially created by the website based on each patient's unique GI PROMIS ""fingerprint"", and can be modified by the provider based on their interaction with the patient. The clinician and patient can also access the PROMIS-tailored education in the exam room to jointly review pertinent materials, including animations of normal and abnormal GI functions, further reinforcing the patients' educational experiences around the PROMIS symptoms.

Patients with low serum magnesium concentration have a higher risk of death, heart issues, muscle cramps and fractures. There are several reasons why patients on dialysis have low levels of magnesium-these include poor diet, medication interference, and the dialysis procedure itself, which leaches small amounts of magnesium from the blood during each treatment.

One way to make sure that patients on dialysis are getting enough magnesium is to increase its concentration in the dialysate. The investigator would like to do a randomized controlled trial to determine the effect of increasing the concentration of magnesium in the dialysate on the risk of people on dialysis dying or being admitted to the hospital due to heart issues. The investigator thinks increasing the magnesium in the dialysate will help patients live longer, have fewer hospitalisations related to heart disease and patients may also experience less cramping associated with dialysis.

This simple adjustment to the dialysis procedure can be done at little cost and may even reduce overall healthcare costs.

"278","NCT05115227","Long-term Multidisciplinary Team-based Management of Back Pain","COMPLETED","Long-term approaches are challenging to implement within the current care system, which rewards clinicians for attempting to quick-fix a long-term condition. This results in increased inappropriate imaging, opioid prescriptions, surgery, and visits/rehabilitation in secondary care, leading to higher societal costs and the continuing increase of LBP-related disability that is currently observed.

The investigators argue that LBP management can be optimized by providing patients with self-management strategies supported by a multidisciplinary team and providing simple, safe, and low-cost interventions that adhere to clinical guidelines. This has the potential to change patient behaviors and facilitate empowerment to self-manage LBP leading to lower societal costs of LBP.

Research objectives

The investigators will develop and test a long-term supportive multidisciplinary team-based management strategy with a specific focus on communicating a structured and unchanging message about individualized diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis, focusing on conducting a large randomized controlled trial as the next phase.

This feasibility trial will be completed in a secondary care settings, where relevant patients with poor management skills and insufficient effects of usual (primary) care management can be identified.

The specific objectives are:

(I) To develop a long-term supportive multidisciplinary team-based management strategy for secondary-care low back pain patients

(II) To test the feasibility by assessing:

* Changes in relevant outcomes
* Utilization of Primary care
* Patients and clinicians experience with the intervention
* Practical challenges of the setting

The management strategy development follows the principles provided by the Medical Research Council for developing complex interventions.

Development of the framework

Step 1: Framework setup

The investigators constructed a basic framework for the intervention by reviewing relevant systematic reviews and clinical guidelines. The research group determined the initial management intervention. Afterward, the investigators conducted a small survey on 191 participants (11% of the total sample of patients between February and May 2021), about their interest in participating. The majority would find such an approach of interest (147(77%)). In parallel, the investigators conducted short semi-structured interviews concerning the intervention with a convenient sample of 20 patients. Seventeen provided usable data.

Step 2 - Development

Using the participants' information, the investigators re-framed the management strategy. Subsequent semi-structured focus-group interviews with a clinical panel for further modifications before testing was conducted.

Step 3 - Feasibility

The multidisciplinary team for the feasibility trial consists of two coordinators (chiropractors), two therapists (physical therapists), one medical doctor, and one nurse.

The feasibility trial aims to identify and develop the appropriate framework by:

I) Investigating the patients' experiences of the current management strategy II) Ensuring satisfactory work-relations between clinicians III) Determining the primary outcome IV) Mapping the multiple interacting components of the management strategy V) Investigating how to measure parallel use of primary care and how this could be applied in the trial evaluation VI) Estimating the workload (number of hours) of the clinicians VII) Quantifying any out-of-protocol behaviors by clinicians and patients alike VIII) Quantifying the different aspects of the intervention using the clinical records

The feasibility trial will include 25 LBP patients from the Spine Centre willing to participate in a limited three-month follow-up.

The intervention procedure is:

1) A team meeting will be held each morning where the coordinator and the feasibility team will go through the patients. This will start the initial sparring process to ensure a structured and unchanging message for the patient.

The coordinator will first assess each patient face-to-face according to ICD-10 principles and enroll eligible patients in the trial. Afterward, the therapist will evaluate the patient's current functional status and management strategy. During the three months, patients will have multiple encounters with the coordinator, the therapist, and the nurse, if needed. The therapist will provide further interventions (e.g., exercise and cognitive/behavioral therapy) to encourage self-management.

The investigators will assess the following outcomes at three months: Disability (primary), pain, self-efficacy, quality of life, LBP trajectory, workability, and work retention.","NO","Low Back Pain","BEHAVIORAL: Education|BEHAVIORAL: Exercise","Disability, The Oswestry disability index, Changes in mean values from baseline to 3 months","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,24,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT","2021-11-10","2022-04-20","2022-04-20","2021-11-10","","2022-04-25","Spine Centre of Southern Denmark, Middelfart, 5500, Denmark","behavioral"

Despite publication of guidelines on the prevention and treatment of COPD, not all COPD patients receive the best available healthcare. Investigators developed a tailored implementation strategy for improving primary care physicians' adherence to COPD management guidelines. The primary aim of the presented trial is to evaluate the effects of this strategy on physician's performance. The secondary aim is to examine the validity of the tailoring of implementation interventions.

Primary Trial Hypothesis: To study if the rate of adherence to the COPD guideline over a 1 year will increase among participants assigned to the intervention group in comparison to those assigned to the control group?

Methods/Design: A two-arm pragmatic cluster randomized trial is planned. A total of 540 patients with diagnosed COPD will be included from 18 general practices in Poland. A tailored implementation program will be offered to general practitioners. Participating physicians in the intervention practices (n=18) will receive training to provide brief anti-smoking counselling. An additional form containing COPD severity scale will be inserted into patient's medical records. The checklist with key information about the disease and its management while consulting a patient with COPD will be provided to practitioners. Investigators will provide practices with training inhaler devices for general practitioners (GPs) to teach patients in correct use of each device and to note this education/training in patient's medical records. The control practices will provide usual care.

"289","NCT04727827","Pharmacogenomic-Guided Supportive Care in Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation","COMPLETED","Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is the only curative treatment modality for many hematologic malignancies. Morbidity and mortality rates have declined drastically over the years, secondary to improvements in both transplant techniques and pharmacotherapies, including immunosuppressants, anti-infectives, analgesics and other supportive care medications. Despite advances in patient care, toxicities associated with HCT (e.g., graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), infection, pain, anxiety, depression, mucositis, nausea/vomiting) continue to pose challenges in patient care and have a significant impact on quality of life. (QOL). A recent study demonstrated subjects randomized to intensive supportive care had a clinically significant improvement in their QOL during hospitalization and up to 3 months post-transplant compared to those receiving standard care.

Further follow up evaluations have evaluated the impact of focused palliative care/symptom management on QOL metrics - inclusive of Edmonton Symptom Assessment surveys (ESAS). In other malignant settings, i.e. solid tumor, ESAS has been noted as an effective measure of symptoms control and the utilization of this assessment is linked to positive outcomes. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) has designated QOL as the second most relevant metric for post-transplant patient care behind survival, making the optimization of supportive care pharmacotherapy a clinically relevant subject to investigate. Pharmacogenetics (PGx) uses an individual's genetic factors, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), to personalize therapy or dose selection. SNPs encode drug-metabolizing enzymes, transporters, and targets that can significantly impact drug efficacy and toxicity. With the growing complexity of both antineoplastics and supportive care, oncologists have less time to manage each subject's myriad of supportive care concerns by trial and error. Suboptimal management of symptoms compromises potential benefits from cancer therapy, disrupts clinic workflow, increases emergency room visits, and affects both patient satisfaction and reimbursement. Genetic variation is well documented across the human genome and affects a subject's response to medications regarding efficacy and toxicity. The genome is quickly becoming a pragmatic tool that can assist oncologists and other providers in optimizing supportive care for subjects with cancer.","NO","Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation|Oncology","OTHER: Pharmacogenomic-guided supportive care","Frequency of subjects undergoing PGx testing who receive at least one drug/dose selection or modification., The primary objective is to estimate the frequency of subjects undergoing PGx testing who receive at least one drug/dose selection or modification based on their test results during the study period, from admission for HCT to HCT Day +100","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,110,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: SUPPORTIVE_CARE","2021-02-01","2023-06-09","2023-06-09","2021-01-27","","2023-08-03","Levine Cancer Institute, Charlotte, North Carolina, 28204, United States","other"

Currently, nonpharmacological management guidelines recommend increasing low levels of physical activity in this group to improve health including cardiovascular health, yet research has shown that people who have RA have reduced levels of PA. Interventions targeting PA behaviour in this population have had limited effect to date due to lack of patient involvement in designing the intervention, poor measurement of PA, lack of behaviour change theory underpinning the intervention and have tended to include people who already have some level of PA. Work to underpin a robust intervention to improve PA in this group has been undertaken by members of this study group including validation of an objective measure PA in RA and interviews with people who have RA and rheumatology health professionals to aid in designing an intervention to promote PA.

The aim of this pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) is to examine the feasibility of a physiotherapist led, behaviour change theory informed, PA intervention to promote PA in people who have RA who have low levels of current PA. This pilot study will determine the rate of recruitment to the study and also determine the acceptability of the intervention to the participants as well as test the feasibility of the secondary disease/PA focused outcome measures.

Participants will be recruited from rheumatology clinics in a large teaching hospital. Participants meeting inclusion criteria will be randomised into an eight week PA intervention (four sessions delivered over an eight week period by a trained physiotherapist) or a control group (PA information leaflet).

"292","NCT04247776","Pragmatic Prehabilitation for Colorectal Surgery","COMPLETED","Colorectal surgery is a common surgery for the treatment of colon and rectal cancers as well as other bowel diseases. Recovery from colorectal surgery is difficult because of the many potential negative side effects. These side effects include surgical complications, infections, and long hospital stays. It usually takes several months for patients to recover the strength required to return to their typical daily activities.

The Enhanced Recovery After Surgery program was established in Alberta in 2013 and uses several strategies to improve short-term patient recovery, including earlier discharge from hospital. Whether the ERAS program also improves long-term patient recovery, including quality of life and return to activities of daily living, is unclear. Whether the ERAS program would benefit from the addition of a prehabilitation element is unclear.

Prehabilitation programs are designed to use the waiting period before colorectal surgery to better prepare patients emotionally and physically for their operation. To date, successful prehabilitation programs have used a personalized care strategy where each patient is provided specific care instructions by healthcare professionals to meet their unique exercise, nutrition, and psychological needs. This prehabilitation strategy has been criticized for not being sustainable in our healthcare system.

A new prehabilitation program in response to this criticism is proposed. The prehabilitation program will be conducted in a more sustainable way by offering the program as a group class with a home-based component. ERAS patients at the Peter Lougheed Center are already offered a group class as part of the standard ERAS program. The prehabilitation class will be an extension of this group class that provides general nutrition, exercise, and anxiety-reduction/relaxation strategies to help patients prepare physically and emotionally for their operation. At this class, patients will learn to eat well, practice deep breathing exercises for relaxation, perform simple functional exercises, and to walk for exercise before their surgery. The surgical experience and outcomes of patients who received the additional prehabilitation care will be compared to those who received ERAS care only.

The overall goal of the study is to better understand how ERAS supports recovery after surgery and whether a prehabilitation program offers any additional benefits to the ERAS program currently in place.","NO","Prehabilitation|Colorectal Surgery|Enhanced Recovery After Surgery","COMBINATION_PRODUCT: Prehab|OTHER: ERAS|BEHAVIORAL: Fitbit","Length of stay (LOS), Length of hospital stay, from date of surgery until hospital discharge, recorded in days, and assessed up to 6 weeks post-surgery","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,110,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT","2018-12-01","2020-09-01","2021-05-01","2020-01-30","","2021-05-05","Peter Lougheed Center, Calgary, Alberta, T1Y 6J4, Canada","combination_product"

CRC is 90% curable with timely detection and appropriate treatment of precancerous polyps; increased screening could reduce incidence by up to 50%. Groups least likely to undergo screening, those with minimal education, low income, low access to health care, recent immigrants or Hispanics, are the same people who frequently receive care at Federally Qualified Healthcare Center's (FQHCs). The use of fecal occult blood tests (FOBT) and fecal immunochemical tests (FIT) is exceedingly low in FQHCs (7-9% of patients in the past year) and far below national averages and target rates. Our results will provide valuable information on how to use electronic health record (EHR) resources to optimize guideline-based screening in FQHC clinics whose patient populations have disproportionately low CRC screening rates.

This project, in conjunction with the research team, will use an advisory panel to direct the research activities. The advisory panel will be made up of clinicians, leaders, researchers, and patients. The panel and team will guide the development of materials, the outreach to patients, and the research protocol to best reach FQHC patients who are due for colorectal cancer screening.

It is also considered the main treatment with the potential to modify allergic disease evolution. It's efficacy and safety in allergic rhinitis and asthma is supported by large systematic reviews and is recommended as a cornerstone treatment option in allergic disease. Molecular based allergy diagnosis has greatly evolved and the knowledge of molecular allergen sensitization pattern has been used to better define the allergen extract composition of AIT. However, uncertainty remains if this strategy is related to an increase of efficacy. Regulation of allergen extracts for allergen immunotherapy are currently underway in Europe, but there is still lack of standardization of relevant allergens and important differences are seen between allergenic contents.

Therefore, we aim to evaluate, in a real-life setting, the impact of using molecular-based diagnosis versus standard diagnostic tools in the efficacy of aeroallergen immunotherapy, using a pragmatic randomized controlled trial design and also to address the impact of the discrepancy between individual aeroallergen sensitization profiles and the major allergen molecular content of aeroallergen immunotherapy.","NO","Asthma|Rhinitis, Allergic","DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Component resolved diagnosis|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Standard diagnosis","Change of combined symptom and medication score (CSMS) at 52 weeks, Differences, in the mean change at 52 weeks, of CSMS between groups that were treated with AIT in the component resolved diagnosis versus standard diagnosis groups.

"303","NCT02629666","Exercise Referral Schemes Enhanced by Self-Management Strategies to Battle Sedentary Behaviour","COMPLETED","The increase of the elderly population leads to increased prevalence of frailty, risk for poor health outcomes, and related health and social care costs. Lack of physical activity (PA) and established sedentary behaviours (SB) constitute an additional burden, as they are related to progression of chronic disease and disabling conditions. An existing initiative to battle SB and insufficient PA levels are exercise referral schemes (ERS) implemented in primary care, where insufficiently active individuals are referred to a third party service (sports centre or leisure facility) that prescribes and monitors an exercise programme tailored to the patients' needs. ERS had shown improvements in PA in the short-term, but may have limited power to change SB and produce long-term effects. Thus, ERS might be enhanced by self-management strategies (SMS) to promote behavioural change. Such strategies based on social cognitive theory have been shown to increase self-confidence, power to act, and involvement in exercise. In a first stage, a systematic review, focus groups and a feasibility study will be conducted. Then, a three-armed pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT) will assess the long-term effectiveness (18-month follow-up) of a complex intervention on sedentary behaviour (SB) in an elderly population, based on existing ERS enhanced by self-management strategies (SMS). It will be compared to ERS alone and to general recommendations plus two educational sessions. The RCT will include 1338 subjects and will have a follow up of 18 months. The effect on SB will be measured as sitting time and the number of minutes spent in activities requiring ≤ 1.5 Metabolic Equivalent Tasks, and PA as daily counts per minute and intensity of exercise, and daily step counts. Secondary outcomes will include: physical function, healthcare use and costs, anthropometry, bioimpedance, blood pressure, self-rated health and quality of life, activities of daily living, anxiety, depressive symptoms, social network, physical activity self-regulation, self-efficacy for exercise, disability, fear of falling, loneliness, executive function, and physical fatigue. In a subsample, the level of frailty-associated biomarkers and inflammation, and sarcopenia-associated markers of muscle quality will be analysed. A process evaluation will be performed throughout the trial.

Adult patients who fulfil the elegibility criteria will be randomized to receive dexamethasone or placebo. Patients who have suffered a head injury and have one or more cerebral contusions with visible pericontusional edema in the CT scan can be included in the study. The doses of dexamethasone will be a short and descending course: 4mg/6 hours (2 days); 4 mg/8 hours (2 days); 2 mg/6 hours (2 days); 2 mg/8 hours (2 days); 1 mg/8 hours (2 days); 1 mg/12 hours (2 days). The primary outcome is the Glasgow Scale Outcome Extended (GOSE) performed one month and 6 months after trauma. Other secondary outcomes are: compare the number of episodes of neurological deterioration; compare the symptoms associated with TBI; compare the presence of adverse events during treatment; compare the volume of pericontusional edema before and after 12 days of treatment in both groups of patients; and compare the results of the neuropsychological tests between the two groups of patients one month and 6 months after the TBI. The main analysis will be on an ''intention-to-treat´´ basis. A descriptive analysis of the baseline variables will be made for each treatment group. Logistic regression will be used to estimate the effect of dexamethasone and placebo on GOSE at one month and at 6 months, dichotomized in unfavorable outcome (GOSE 1-6) and favorable outcome (GOSE 7-8). Since the severity of the initial injury will determine significantly the final outcome of the patient, to assess the effect of dexamethasone, efficacy will also be analyzed using the 'sliding dichotomy'. A subgroup analysis will be carried out by stratifying the patients as they present more or less than 10mL of pericontusional edema in the preinclusion CT. We will perform an interim analysis with the patients included during the first year to calculate the conditional power. An independent statistician will blindly perform this analysis.

"317","NCT03939520","Management of Progressive Disease in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis","RECRUITING","Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a prototype of chronic, progressive, and fibrotic lung disease. It has been considered rare, with an incidence estimated to 11.5 cases per 100 000 individuals per year. Increasing rates of hospital admissions and deaths due to IPF suggest an increasing burden of disease. The median survival time from diagnosis is 2-4 years.

Recently two disease-modifying therapies, pirfenidone and nintedanib, have been approved worldwide. Both drugs reduce the disease progression as measured by progressive decline in forced vital capacity (FVC), with a reduction of overall mortality showed by meta-analysis of phase III pirfenidone trials.

However, progression of disease continues to occur despite the currently available drug therapy. Many patients die from progressive, chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure, or less frequently from acute exacerbation of pulmonary fibrosis. In these patients, no data are available to guide management between continuation of the prescribed antifibrotic drug, to switch to the other available antifibrotic drug, or to combine the available drugs.

The combination of nintedanib and pirfenidone is not recommended outside clinical trials. However, although both antifibrotic drugs were developed and approved as monotherapy, two recent trials have suggested the feasibility and safety of combining them over a 12-24 weeks period. These results encourage further studies of combination treatment with pirfenidone and nintedanib in patients with IPF. Such study is timely, as there is a risk that clinicians facing the continued worsening of disease in patients receiving one of the available drugs may prescribe both drugs combined outside clinical trials, potentially exposing patients to a currently unknown risk.

This study will evaluate the efficacy and tolerance of the combination pirfenidone and nintedanib as compared to a ""switch monotherapy"": i.e. switching from the current to the other of the two existing drugs prescribed as monotherapy, in patients who present chronic worsening IPF despite receiving either pirfenidone or nintedanib and as to a ""control group"": i.e.treatment still be on as before randomization (pirfenidone or nintedanib).","NO","Progressive Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis","DRUG: pirfenidone and nintedanib|DRUG: pirfenidone or nintedanib|DRUG: pirfenidone or nintedanib","Slope of the decline in the forced vital capacity (FVC) measured by spirometry, FVC will be measured by spirometry, 24 weeks","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT","PHASE4",378,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT","2020-06-11","2026-01","2026-01","2019-05-06","","2023-08-04","CHU d'Angers, Angers, France|Centre Hospitalier de la côte Basque, Bayonne, France|CHRU de Besançon - Hôpital Jean Minjoz, Besançon, France|AP - HP - Hôpital Avicenne, Bobigny, France|CHRU Hôpital Cavale Blanche, Brest, France|Hôpital Pneumologique et Cardiovasculaire Louis Pradel, Bron, France|CHU de Caen - Hôpital de la Côte de Nacre, Caen, France|CHU Dijon Bourgogne - Hôpital François Mitterrand, Dijon, France|CHRU de Lille - Hôpital Albert Calmette, Lille, France|CHU de Marseille - Hôpital Nord, Marseille, France|CHRU de Montpellier - Hôpital Arnaud de Villeneuve, Montpellier, France|CHU - Hôpital G.R.

Most studies on ARF have focused on patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) after they have been on mechanical ventilation for days and end organ damage is already established. The overall goal of this proposed project is to improve the outcomes of patients at high risk for developing severe ARF and prolonged mechanical ventilation in and outside of the ICU. The project aims to intervene early in high risk patients with an electronic medical records (EMR)-based, patient-centered checklist of common critical care practices aimed at preventing lung injury and hospital acquired adverse events that commonly lead to organ failure (Prevention of Organ Failure checklist -PROOFcheck). This application proposes a stepped-wedge, clustered randomized control trial to determine the utility of PROOFcheck to improve survival and reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation and multiple organ failure in patients identified as high risk for progressing to severe ARF and prolonged mechanical ventilation. The aims in the UH2 phase are: 1) to refine a previously validated Lung Injury Prediction Score into a pragmatic, EMR-based early prediction model to Accurately Predict Prolonged Ventilation (APPROVE), which will automatically identify patients anywhere in the hospital who are at high risk for developing severe ARF requiring mechanical ventilation \>48 hours; 2) to incorporate PROOFcheck into the EMR to prompt clinicians on care practices to limit lung injury, prevent adverse events, and avoid additional organ failure; and 3) to establish the infrastructure for the proposed trial. The proposed pragmatic trial will harness the hospital-wide EMR to identify patients at high risk for prolonged mechanical ventilation with APPROVE for intervention with PROOFcheck. As such, the proposed trial aims to break out of the clinical silos by which care is currently organized in the hospital and bring patient-centered, context appropriate care to the acutely ill patient wherever and whenever the patient's condition requires it.","NO","Respiratory Failure|Multiple Organ Failure","OTHER: PROOFcheck|OTHER: Standard Care","Hospital Mortality, up to 1 year","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,34040,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: SINGLE (PARTICIPANT)|Primary Purpose: PREVENTION","2015-08","2018-09","2018-09","2015-07-02","","2019-02-08","Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida, 32224, United States|Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, 55902, United States|Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York, 10467, United States","other"

"322","NCT05503966","Combining Antidepressants and Attention Bias Modification in Depression","RECRUITING","Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly prevalent psychiatric condition associated with significant disability, mortality and economic burden. A large proportion of MDD patients are treated in primary health care (PHC) in the municipalities and represent a challenging group. Attentional Bias Modification (ABM) training in combination with antidepressants (SSRIs) could be an effective treatment. The overall aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that adding an ABM procedure to regular treatment with antidepressants in PHC will result in further improvement of symptoms compared to treatment with antidepressants alone (treatment as usual, TAU) and as compared to an active comparison condition.

Methods: A total of 246 patients with a diagnosis of MDD will be included in this study. The study is a three-armed pragmatic randomized controlled trial comparing the efficacy of ABM as add-on to treatment with antidepressants in primary care (ABM condition) compared to standard antidepressant treatment (TAU condition). In a third group participants will complete the same schedule of intermediate assessments as the ABM condition in addition to TAU , but no ABM, thus controlling for the non-training-specific aspects of the ABM condition (SSRI Active comparison group).

Discussion:

The clinical outcome of this study may help develop easy accessible, low cost treatment of depression in PHC.

"337","NCT01994226","Colchicine Or Naproxen Treatment for ACute gouT","COMPLETED","Gout is the most common cause of inflamed joints affecting 1.4% of adults in the UK. Most patients are treated entirely in general practice yet primary care management is frequently suboptimal. Acute attacks of gout are excruciatingly painful and require urgent drug treatment to reduce inflammation, most commonly with antiinflammatory drugs(NSAIDs) or colchicine. In primary care, NSAIDs are most commonly used but can cause serious side effects such as stomach ulcers and heart disease, particularly in the elderly. Patients frequently require repeat prescriptions for recurrent attacks of acute gout increasing the risk of drug-related side-effects. Low-dose colchicine is popular amongst rheumatologists as it is effective and well tolerated. However, general practitioners (GPs) prescribe colchicine infrequently, probably because in the past the recommendation was for high doses to be prescribed which commonly caused severe diarrhoea. Recently, prescribing recommendations for colchicine have changed, advocating a lower dose regime.

Currently there is no evidence regarding whether NSAIDs or low-dose colchicine is the best treatment for acute gout. This trial will be the first direct comparison of the effectiveness and side effects of a NSAID (naproxen) and low-dose colchicine to treat acute gout in primary care. Naproxen will be used in this trial because it has been shown to be as effective as oral prednisolone for the treatment of acute gout, is safer than other commonly used NSAIDs such as diclofenac and indomethacin, and is inexpensive.

Patients consulting their GP with an acute attack of gout in up to 100 general practices will be invited to participate. Treatment success will be assessed by comparing pain reduction between the two drugs. The trial will also monitor side effects, quality of life, and cost effectiveness.","YES","Gout","DRUG: Low-dose colchicine|DRUG: Naproxen 750 mg/250 mg","Change in Pain Intensity, Worst pain intensity in last 24 hours using a 0 - 10 numeric rating scale, where high rates (10) indicate worst outcome, Days 0-7","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT","PHASE4",399,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT","2014-01","2016-03","2016-03","2013-11-25","2017-04-12","2019-06-18","Keele University, Stoke-on-Trent, United Kingdom","drug"

Patients ≥ 50 years with small, low-risk breast cancer who are operated but not irradiated show local relapse rates around 6% after 5 years. With adjuvant whole breast radiotherapy (WBRT) the local relapse rate drops to under 1% after 5 years under Tamoxifen (4).

It has been demonstrated (6, 9, 10) that the efficacy of radiation of the tumor bed only in a selected group can be non-inferior to WBRT.

The TARGIT C study should confirm the efficacy of a single dose of intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) in a well selected group of patients with small breast cancer and absence of risk factors. In presence of risk factors postoperative WBRT will be added to complete the radiotherapeutic treatment according to international guidelines.

Endpoints are the local relapse rate (within 2 cm of the tumor bed), ipsilateral relapse, cancer-specific and overall survival and contralateral breast cancer as well as documentation of quality of life and cosmetic outcome.

The expected local relapse rates are 0.825/1.375% after 3/5 years, respectively. Discontinuation of the trial is scheduled if rates of local relapse rates rise to 1.55/2.4/4% after 1/3/5 years. Power calculations result in 387 patients with a calculated dropout and loss to follow-up rate of 10%, an alpha of 0.05 and a beta of 0.10. There will be only a pre-pathology stratum.

PFM training is effective for UI treatment, when occurs intensively (daily), with physiotherapy supervision for at least 3 months. However, adhearance to such intense treatment is very often compromised. We therefore believe that a telerehabilitation programme, such as a mobile application (app) in collaboration with a pelvic floor muscle sensor and with the simultaneous supervision of the physiotherapist (via the mobile app), will provide sufficient motivation for the patient to adhere with daily exercises.

The development of tele-rehabilitation programs through mobile applications (mobile apps) has been a breakthrough for UI treatment. The pelvic floor muscle (PFM) exercise programs through mobile apps, provide optimal health care services by offering to the patients a therapy program in the convenient environment of their homes, with safety and less expense. Moreover, the majority of the existence mobile apps, work as simple verbal instructions, do not being tailored in patients' individual needs, and they are not able to assess the right direction of PFM contraction (inwardly and towards the navel), which is necessary for the successful implementation of the PFM exercises.

Therefore the main purpose of the study is to investigate the effectiveness of a tele-rehabilitation program, through a novel, innovative mobile app in cooperation with a pelvic floor muscle sensor, indicating the direction of the PFM contraction in real time, which might be effective in UI treatment. The mobile app as well as the pelvic floor sensor will be created for the needs of the present study. A secondary objective of the study will be to investigate the degree of adherence to PFM exercises and the degree of supervision, which needs in the tele-rehabilitation program. The present study is designed to be conducted as a prospective randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) with three arms.

We believe that the contribution of the current research has a social and economic impact on the life of the Greek woman with incontinence and this lies in the fact that, it is a fast, easy-to-use, modern approach opening new horizons in the field of rehabilitation. In addition, the patient maintains her interest in the exercises, performs them safely, more economically in her own time and in a familiar environment of her choice.

"363","NCT04441034","Stanford Pragmatic Effectiveness Comparison","RECRUITING","Chronic pain is a major healthcare problem with an annual cost of above $600 billion. The quality of data available for treatments of chronic pain is not optimal. Generalizability of explanatory randomized controlled trial data is problematic as these trials exclude up to 90% of patients: leaving out real-world patients with serious medical and psychological comorbidities. Pragmatic trials embedded in patient care compare effectiveness of currently used treatments in real-world application leading to findings that generalize to broader range of patients.

The changes in clinical practice and workflow necessary to integrate this type of research within patient care present pragmatic challenges. In this research, the overall objective is to overcome these challenges using an open-source learning health care system - CHOIR. CHOIR is currently used to track patients' clinical trajectory and treatment response across multiple academic sites resulting in over 25 publications characterizing chronic pain. Through the pilot studies, the investigators have already developed a point-of-care randomization for CHOIR that facilitates integration of research and patient care by allowing the physicians to randomize patients during clinic visits. The investigators have already demonstrated feasibility of the randomization and data collection platform in two ongoing pilot pragmatic clinical trials.

The investigators are proposing to better integrate pragmatic research within clinical practice through conducting a randomized comparative effectiveness trial in 450 patients with chronic pain comparing effectiveness of anti-convulsants and anti-depressants (two most commonly used classes of medications for treatment of chronic pain). The investigators will also perform a qualitative interview with all physicians in our clinic to study the impact of integrating pragmatic research into clinical care. The investigators will use the data available in CHOIR as well as the real-world data generated from this clinical trial to build, validate and test a model to predict what clinical characteristics can predict response to either of these classes of medications.

The proposed study is the first step to use flexible point-of-care randomization to compare effectiveness of different treatments in different subgroups of patients whenever equipoise exists. The prediction model will guide decision making process of clinicians choosing between these medications based on clinical characteristics of individual patients.","NO","Chronic Pain","DRUG: Anti-convulsant medications|DRUG: Anti-depressant medications","Change in Pain Intensity, Change in pain intensity on numerical rating scale (0-10; worse is higher) of pain at 6 months, 6 months","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT","PHASE4",450,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT","2022-04-12","2025-09-30","2025-09-30","2020-06-22","","2024-03-12","Stanford Pain Management Center, Redwood City, California, 94063, United States","drug"

However; this gave rise to a growing population of women living long after breast cancer with a diminished quality of life (QoL) due to the long-term effects of cancer and cancer treatment.

Exercise can improve QoL, fatigue, and other mental and physical health outcomes in this population, and is strongly recommended among breast cancer survivors, much like a healthy diet. However adherence in real-life to these recommendations is seldom satisfactory. Also, evidence regarding the effect and cost-effectiveness of concurrent healthy lifestyle behaviors compared to exercise alone is limited. Hence the need to develop pragmatic (evaluating the effectiveness of interventions in real-life conditions) theoretical-based customized interventions, which aim to improve uptake and instill long-term adherence of health lifestyle among breast cancer survivors.

ADA (Activité physique adaptée Doublée d'un Accompagnement spécifique post-cancer) is an integrative intervention based on physical activity, nutrition and supportive care. The interventions aims to improve breast cancer survivors' physical and mental health and instill long-term healthy behaviors.

Our study will be a pragmatic two-arm (ADA intervention versus control/usual care) cluster randomized controlled trial which examines the effectiveness of the ADA intervention program.

Despite evidence that falls can be prevented, fall related injuries have not declined over time. Current fall injury prevention techniques targeting mobility and bone strength have merit yet their effectiveness is limited. Indeed, a recent Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute/National Institute on Aging funded pragmatic trial of individualized multifactorial strategy to prevent serious fall injuries in over 5500 seniors revealed no difference in fall injuries between the intervention and standard care arm. The inconclusive results of the investigation may be due in part to focusing on fall prevention rather than mitigation of fall-related impact acceleration and forces - the ""fundamental variables"" for injury prevention. A fall-related injury occurs when the body hits the ground with force that is greater than tissue strength. Development of innovative approaches that focus on fundamental variables of injury prevention is needed.","NO","Fall Injury|Fall Patients|Mobility Limitation","OTHER: FAST Program|OTHER: Otago Exercise Program","Physical discomfort related to the intervention, The hypothesis is that there will be minimally greater musculoskeletal discomfort in the FAST group that than in the Otago Exercise Program group, but no difference in adverse events.

However, the best option regarding the drug(s) to add remains unclear. Rheumatologists are currently used to adding a targeted therapy, such as anti-TNFα, and more recently abatacept or tocilizumab. Triple therapy using 3 conventional disease-modifying drugs (DMARDs), methotrexate or leflunomide+salazopyrine+hydroxychloroquine could be an alternative option to targeted therapies, all the more as they have a more favorable safety profile and a much lower cost.

"393","NCT03610217","Pragmatic Clinical Trials in Scleroderma","UNKNOWN","Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) is an autoimmune connective tissue disease characterized by autoantibodies, fibrosis and microvascular injury and endothelial cell activation that results in vascular damage. Vascular injury induces both innate and acquired immune responses resulting in fibroblast activation and organ fibrosis. SSc may target multiple organs, including: skin, lungs, heart, vascularization, kidneys, the gastrointestinal tract and musculoskeletal structures. Mortality among scleroderma patients is significant, with a 3.5 standardized mortality ratio (SMR) in studies of prevalent cases. This mortality may be increased in the early years of the disease, reaching a SMR of 4 in a multinational inception cohort. In general, treatment strategies target involved organs as early as possible to avoid damage. Many treatment options are available for each manifestation, but evidence with respect to the order of treatment is scarce. Financial costs, the lack of proper outcome measures, difficulty to recruit patients as a rare disease, all prevent the development of new big clinical trials, oppositely to other common diseases such as stroke or cancer. The heterogeneous features of SSc may make trials challenging. The current guidelines available are the British guidelines (2017) , and the updated European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) guidelines, published in 2017. Management guidelines have some gaps regarding second-line treatment, combinations and there are no proposed algorithms.

With the pragmatic trials, the investigators intend to fill the gap between the complicated randomized clinical trials and the observational studies. Using the treatments that have already been proved useful in SSc, in an open-label randomized way and based on some refined expert-made algorithms, will allow the investigators to establish the order in how to use them.

Patients will be offered to participate with the collection of their clinical data and, if they give their consent, they will be randomized according to the algorithms.

Following THA and TKA post-discharge physical rehabilitation is common practice, but vary significantly regarding content, duration, intensity and mode of delivery. Recent systematic reviews have found home-based rehabilitation to be as good as outpatient rehabilitation in terms of pain and physical function. Additionally, no long-term benefits seem to persist compared to minimal or no intervention following THA or TKA; questioning the true effectiveness of postoperative rehabilitation. However, a true ""no intervention"" (e.g. no prescribed exercises) has never been investigated following total THA or TKA. The purpose of this present trial is to compare the effectiveness of telerehabilitation, unsupervised rehabilitation and no rehabilitation to enhance recovery following THA and TKA.

Methods: This pragmatic, randomised controlled trial will include 168 patients following discharge after THA or TKA. Patients will be randomized into one of the three 6-week interventions: telerehabilitation, unsupervised rehabilitation or no intervention. The trial is designed as a superiority trial to test the hypothesis that rehabilitation (telerehabilitation and unsupervised rehabilitation) is superior to no rehabilitation. The primary outcome will be the difference between intervention groups in terms of the mean score of the Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS)/ the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)-subscale: function of daily living at first follow-up (end of the 6-week intervention). Additional follow-up are scheduled at 3 and 12 months. Outcome assessors and data analysts are blinded to group allocation.

Hypothermia is independently associated with mortality in traumatically injured patients due to its negative physiologic effects on hemostasis, cardiorespiratory and renal function.

Current warming strategies increase the logistical difficulty of transferring patients (which is frequent during the initial hours of trauma care) or must be changed at frequent intervals. Prehospital, military, and intraoperative studies have suggested chemical warming blankets as a pragmatic strategy to manage hypothermia. A recent pilot study (manuscript under review) at our institution demonstrated the feasibility of using the Ready-Heat® (TechTrade LLC, Orlando, FL, USA) chemical heating blanket in the initial phases of hospital care in bleeding trauma patients requiring a mass hemorrhage protocol (MHP). These self-warming blankets provide warmth over 8 hours at up to 40 degrees Celsius, carrying the advantage of portability with no continuous electric power requirement. Furthermore, the Ready-Heat blanket may be more effective than current strategies for rewarming patients at high risk of developing hypothermia. STAYWARM-2 will be the first randomized controlled trial performed in-hospital to evaluate a self-warming blanket to address hypothermia in massively bleeding trauma patients within the initial hours of hospital arrival.

This study will help to determine the efficacy and feasibility of using chemical heating blankets for hypothermia in the early hours of hospital care. This has potential to reduce the overall workload of direct care clinicians, freeing them for other patient care duties. Additionally, the intervention may achieve enhanced thermoregulation compared to current strategies, improving patient care and comfort, and avoiding the clinical complications related to hypothermia.

No studies have evaluated the barriers to routine outcome measurement in Singapore's healthcare settings nor identified effective implementation strategies to sustain the use of outcome measures in practice.

Aims: To evaluate the effectiveness of a tailored multi-component implementation intervention effectiveness in improving the consistency of use of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Upper Extremity (FMA) among occupational therapists practicing in 4 hospitals in Singapore.

Method: The project will use the Normalisation Process Theory as a framework and data collection sites will include Singapore General Hospital, Sengkang General Hospital, Outram Community Hospital, and Sengkang Community Hospital. The investigators will use a stepped-wedge randomised trial design. The study will begin with an initial period in which no hospitals are exposed to the intervention. Subsequently, at regular intervals, one hospital will cross from the control to the intervention. The investigators will continue this process until the intervention is introduced to all hospitals. The intervention will be fully implemented by the end of the trial, with all 4 hospitals receiving the multi-component intervention.

Project Significance: This trial is part of a larger project that uses a theory-driven approach to systematically explore the embedding and integration of outcome measures in routine clinical care for rehabilitation professionals in Singapore (beyond initial implementation stages). Study findings will contribute to the scientific knowledge base of implementing outcome measures in clinical practice, improve patient care, and support future implementation projects on outcome measurement in different populations and healthcare settings.","NO","Implementation Science|Stroke","OTHER: Multi-component implementation intervention","Adherence rate, Average rate of adherence to the administration of the FMA by occupational therapists, 6 months post-intervention","ALL","CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,4,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: SEQUENTIAL|Masking: SINGLE (PARTICIPANT)|Primary Purpose: OTHER","2022-07-06","2023-06-16","2023-06-16","2022-05-16","","2022-10-26","Singapore General Hospital, Singapore, Singapore","other"

"406","NCT05537935","Low Dose Naltrexone for Pain in Patients With HIV","SUSPENDED","The increased life expectancy of Patients Living With HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) has increased the need for therapies for chronic conditions, such as chronic pain. Pain in the HIV population is often refractory and ends up being treated with chronic opioids, which are associated with adverse effects, including hyperalgesia, constipation, and risk of overdose. Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist used in the treatment of alcohol and opioid use disorders. Low Dose Naltrexone (LDN), naltrexone at a much lower dose, is thought to be an immune modulator and has been associated with an increased CD4 count in PLWHA. Repurposing this medication is relatively inexpensive, and has the potential to expand access to treatment for a painful condition experienced in PLWHA. While there are many case reports on the efficacy of LDN in symptom reduction, there are only a small number of clinical trials that specifically examine pain and symptom relief.

This study will include patients who are not completely virologically controlled and will monitor the CD4 counts drawn as a part of routine care. If the CD4 count improves with LDN and with reduced symptoms, this could be a significant improvement in HIV therapy for symptom control. There have been studies showing cytokine reduction in fibromyalgia patients but they did not investigate the correlation with cytokines and pain relief. This study involves repurposing of a drug used for substance use disorder to a medication with the potential to treat pain and improve symptoms for PLWHA.","NO","Human Immunodeficiency Virus|Chronic Neuropathic Pain","DRUG: Low Dose Naltrexone","Changes in Numerical Pain Score, The study team will give participants a link to the online PROMIS questionnaire that includes a numerical pain rating scale (NPRS) to complete using an iPad or computer and will verbally ask questions to establish baseline information required for the study.

The Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) is a subjective measure in which individuals rate their pain on an eleven-point numerical scale. The scale is composed of 0 (no pain at all) to 10 (worst imaginable pain).

Changes on the overall score of the PROMIS-29 Profile v2.0 questionnaire collected at baseline, 4, 8 and 12 weeks will be assessed.

The patients' answers to the PROMIS-29 are scored from 1-5. The sum of the PROMIS results in the raw score, which lies between 4 and 20. There is no total score, but each axis forms its own score. PROMIS assessments use an Item Response Theory (IRT) based score called ""Expected A Posteriori"" or EAP scores, which are then transformed onto a final T-score metric.

"407","NCT03044158","GeneXpert Performance Evaluation for Linkage to Tuberculosis Care","COMPLETED","The investigators' overall objective is to assess the effectiveness, implementation and costs of a streamlined TB diagnostic evaluation strategy based around rapid, onsite molecular testing. The intervention strategy was developed based on theory-informed assessment of barriers to TB diagnostic evaluation at community health centers in Uganda and a process of engagement with local stakeholders. It includes: 1) Point-of-care molecular testing using GeneXpert as a replacement for sputum smear microscopy; 2) Re-structuring of clinic-level procedures to facilitate same-day TB diagnosis and treatment; and 3) Quarterly feedback of TB evaluation metrics to health center staff. The investigators' central hypothesis is that the intervention strategy will have high uptake and increase the number of patients diagnosed with and treated for active pulmonary TB. To test this hypothesis, the investigators will conduct a pragmatic cluster-randomized trial at community health centers that provide TB microscopy services in Uganda in partnership with the National TB Program (NTP). The investigators utilize an effectiveness-implementation hybrid design in which, concurrent with the clinical trial, the investigators will conduct nested mixed methods, health economic and modeling studies to assess 1) whether the intervention strategy modifies targeted barriers to TB diagnostic evaluation; 2) fidelity of implementation of the intervention components (i.e, the degree to which intervention components were implemented as intended vs. adapted across sites); and 3) cost-effectiveness and public health impact.","NO","Tuberculosis, Pulmonary|Rifampicin Resistant Tuberculosis","DEVICE: GeneXpert I|BEHAVIORAL: Process re-design|OTHER: Performance Feedback","Number treated for microbiologically-confirmed TB within two weeks of referral for sputum-based testing, Effectiveness outcome., Within 2 weeks of initial sputum submission","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,10644,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: DIAGNOSTIC","2018-10-22","2020-03-31","2022-07-31","2017-02-06","","2023-04-20","St Francis Njeru Health Center III, Buikwe, Uganda|Busana Health Center III, Busana, Uganda|Busesa Health Center IV, Busesa, Uganda|Buwama Health Center III, Buwama, Uganda|Iganga TC, Iganga, Uganda|Bukulula Health Center IV, Kalungu, Uganda|Nazigo Health Center III, Kayunga, Uganda|Kiganda Health Center IV, Kiganda, Uganda|Kira Health Center III, Kira, Uganda|Lugasa Health Center III, Lugala, Uganda|Bishop Asili Health Center, Luwero, Uganda|Kinoni Health Center III, Lwengo, Uganda|Kityerera Health Center IV, Mayuge, Uganda|Malongo Health Center III, Mayuge, Uganda|Mayuge Health Center III, Mayuge, Uganda|Wabulungu Health Center III, Mayuge, Uganda|Malangala Health Center III, Mityana, Uganda|Lwampanga Health Center III, Nakasongola, Uganda|Namungalwe Health Center III, Namungalwe, Uganda|Nankandulo Health Center IV, Nankandulo, Uganda","device"

Although pharmacological and psychological treatments for anxiety and depression have existed for several years now, only a minority of anxiety disorder sufferers are treated according to guidelines. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is the most consistently efficacious psychological treatment for anxiety disorders, but implementation of CBT in primary care is challenging due to limited resources. Recent studies indicate that transdiagnostic group CBT for multiple anxiety disorders could be a promising alternative to individual CBT in primary care. The aim of the study is to examine the effectiveness of group CBT for anxiety disorders as a complement to usual care. The clinical trial will be conducted in three Health and Social Services Centers in the province of Québec (i.e. Sherbrooke, Laval and Québec). Patients will be French-speaking adults with anxiety disorders, and they will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment conditions: a) Transdiagnostic group CBT (12 weekly 2-hour sessions), b) usual care. The transdiagnostic group CBT will be offered as a differed intervention to participants in the usual care group after the 8-month follow up. Participants in both study arms will undergo a baseline clinical evaluation as well as outcome assessment interviews at post-treatment, 4, 8, and 12 month follow-up time-points.

"419","NCT01804322","Standardized Educational Plan for Epilepsy Patients With Comorbidities","COMPLETED","Epilepsy requires long-term drug treatment and is frequently associated with other clinical conditions. Combinations of antiepileptic drugs and other compounds are fairly common and increase with age. Adverse drug reactions and drug interactions are expected and may affect compliance, particularly in patients not receiving adequate information. Primary objective of the study is to verify if a comprehensive and standardized educational plan is followed by a significant reduction of the number of adult patients with epilepsy and comorbidity presenting clinically relevant adverse treatment effects. Secondary objectives include effects on number of adverse treatment events, health-related quality of life (HRQOL), direct medical costs, and patient's compliance. The study is a randomized, controlled, open-label, pragmatic trial. Included are consecutive adult outpatients with 1+ concurrent clinical conditions on chronic treatment and at least one clinically relevant treatment-related adverse event and/or clinically relevant drug interaction. Eligible patients will be randomized to receive a comprehensive and standardized educational plan (experimental arm) or to usual care, ie management of adverse event/drug interaction as done in clinical practice (control arm). The experimental plan consists in discussing with patient and caregiver the cause and nature of adverse event/drug interaction, the tolerability profile of each drug, the clinical manifestations associated with current drug interaction(s), contraindications of potentially interfering over-the-counter drugs, indications and benefits of suggested treatment changes, and withdrawal of potentially interfering, contraindicated or ineffective drugs. All patients will be seen at one, three and six months after admission.

Expected results: The number of patients free from clinically relevant adverse treatment events and/or drug interactions in each treatment arm at end of study is expected to be higher in patients assigned to comprehensive and standardized educational plan compared to usual care (primary outcome). Patients on the experimental plan are also expected to be more commonly free from relevant adverse events and/or drug interactions at each intermediate visit, to present a lower number of adverse treatment events, to imply lower costs for medical contacts, hospital admissions, and drugs, to present better HRQOL scores, and to present less weekly treatment omissions.","NO","Epilepsy","OTHER: Standardized educational plan|OTHER: usual care","The primary outcome is defined by the number of patients free from clinically relevant adverse treatment events and/or drug interactions in each treatment arm at end of study., 6 months","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT","PHASE4",187,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT","2009-02","2011-12","2012-09","2013-03-05","","2013-03-06","Azienda Ospedaliera San Gerardo, Central Contact (9 recruting centers), Monza, MB, 20900, Italy","other"

ASCVD risk interventions such as statin medications are not effective if initiated when kidney disease is advanced. Thus, early recognition of CKD is important for effective ASCVD risk management. Patient centered medical homes (PCMH)s (clinics which include nurse educators, dietitians, pharmacists and social workers) were designed to address gaps in care for complex chronic diseases such as CKD by increasing availability of ancillary services for patients. However, PCMH models have not been shown to improve the recognition and treatment of CKD and its associated ASCVD risk. The E DYNAMIC CDS retrieves real-time patient data from the electronic health record (EHR) every 24 hours to help primary care providers (PCP) identify patients with CKD and assess ASCVD risk and provide appropriate treatment. E-DYNAMIC also delegates CKD care with utilization of an opt-out approach for nurse education and dietitian referral. The overall objective of this pragmatic trial is to examine whether the E-DYNAMIC CDS increases PCP recognition of CKD and use of ASCVD risk management interventions when implemented within a PCMH. This pragmatic trial will be conducted within the Hines VA Hospital and community-based outpatient clinics designed as PCMH called teamlets. Teamlets include several PCPs, a nurse educator, a dietitian, a pharmacist, and a social worker. We will randomize 51 teamlets to the E-DYNAMIC CDS or to standard care.

Supportive care therapies are commonly prescribed to nearly all cancer patients and could include antiemetics (ondansetron), pain management (opiates), GI protection (PPIs), antidepressants (select SSRIs), anticoagulation (warfarin) and antifungal prophylaxis (voriconazole). These are all are associated with known pharmacogenetic interactions, which in some cases render the drugs ineffective or toxic. This could result in negative impacts on quality of life in patients who are already undergoing complicated and costly anticancer regimens. Pharmacogenetic-guided therapy based on an individual patient's genetic profile could potentially target symptoms for which an individual is uniquely susceptible, guiding use of medications that are most likely to be effective, thereby reducing unnecessary physical complications and financial strain.

"434","NCT04310462","Effectiveness of an EHR Interface to Reduce Dosage of Hydroxychloroquine","ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING","Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is a disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic drug that regulates immune system activity and is typically prescribed to treat rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus, as well as other immune conditions. Although generally well tolerated, study data have demonstrated that long-term use of HCQ may lead to irreversible and potentially vision-threatening retinal toxicity. The American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) issued guidelines in 2011, and again in 2016 that recommended dosing of HCQ be based on an individual's body weight, and also outlined how and when to screen for retinal toxicity. While clinicians have been aware of the potential side effects of HCQ for decades, studies have shown that many patients continue to receive higher than recommended doses.

The goal of this study is to conduct a pragmatic trial to assess the utility of a new e-prescribing (eRX) interface for prescriptions of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). The investigators will measure the effectiveness of the system in reducing the number of individuals prescribed HCQ over current guidelines by randomizing clinicians to the new interface. Ideally, the eRX interface will result in a lower number of potential adverse events (i.e. retinal toxicity) associated with high-dose, long-term use of HCQ.","NO","Rheumatic Diseases","OTHER: New e-prescribing interface","Prevalence of dosage above guidelines: 6.5 mg/kg (2011), Prevalence of dosage above 6.5 mg/kg, Post intervention: 1 year|Prevalence of dosage above guidelines: 6.5 mg/kg (2011), Prevalence of dosage above 6.5 mg/kg, Post intervention: 2 years|Prevalence of dosage above guidelines: 6.5 mg/kg (2011), Prevalence of dosage above 6.5 mg/kg, Post intervention: 3 years|Prevalence of dosage above guidelines: 5.0 mg/kg (2016), Prevalence of dosage above 5.0 mg/kg, Post intervention: 1 year|Prevalence of dosage above guidelines: 5.0 mg/kg (2016), Prevalence of dosage above 5.0 mg/kg, Post intervention: 2 years|Prevalence of dosage above guidelines: 5.0 mg/kg (2016), Prevalence of dosage above 5.0 mg/kg, Post intervention: 3 years","ALL","CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,65,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","2017-02-01","2025-02","2025-02","2020-03-17","","2023-07-06","University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, 94143, United States","other"

"440","NCT02720822","Breathlessness Exertion and Morphine Sulphate","COMPLETED","Breathlessness is an overwhelming symptom affecting tens of thousands of Australians every day. For many people, it persists even when all the underlying causes have been optimally managed (chronic breathlessness). In these circumstances, it often occurs at rest or with minimal exertion.

Evidence from a number of clinical studies suggests that a small, regular dose of morphine helps to reduce safely the sensation of breathlessness. However, it is not well established which patients derive more benefit and what is the net clinical effect of this treatment (weighing benefits and harms).

This is a phase III, multi-site, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and severe chronic breathlessness which will explore several important questions:

* Are regular, low doses of morphine at four possible doses over 3 weeks more effective than placebo at improving breathlessness?
* Does increasing the dose in people who already are experiencing some benefit provide even greater reduction in worst breathlessness?
* Does the medication have any effect on daily activity and quality of life?
* What are the common or serious side effects of this intervention?
* Does the benefit from the medication outweigh the side effects it produces?
* Are there specific characteristics of people who are more likely to receive benefit from extended release morphine?

Participants will receive once daily extended release morphine (plus laxative, docusate with senna), or placebo (placebo laxative) in addition to their usual medication for up to 3 weeks at increasing doses.

Participants will have a medical interview and physical examination to collect some general health information, and baseline measurements including; daily activity, symptoms, and quality of life. A small amount of blood may be required to check eligibility. Further blood samples may be taken at week 1 and 3 to enable testing on how individuals respond to opioids, further consent will be obtained for these samples.

Data on benefits, side effects, and medical care will be collected during comprehensive weekly visits. Participants will also fill out a simple diary twice daily for weeks one to three of the study, and for one day each week during an optional 6 month extension stage.

The outcome of this study may enable better management of symptoms and activity in people COPD with medicines that are shown to be effective and safe.","NO","Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease|Dyspnea","DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: Morphine Sulfate|DRUG: Plus laxative (Docusate with senna)|DRUG: Plus placebo laxative|DEVICE: FitBit charge HR (Accelerometer)","Change from baseline worst breathlessness intensity over the previous 24 hours, Rated on a 0-10 numerical rating scale (NRS).

"443","NCT01721239","Recovery and Aftercare in Post Intensive Care Therapy Patients - RAPIT Study","COMPLETED","In 2010 alone were admitted 33,361 patients for treatment in Danish intensive care units. There is evidence to former intensive care patients have a significant symptom burden that affect recovery, function and activity for up to several years after admission to the intensive care unit. For the individual patient involves the low quality of life, delayed recovery, prolonged illness and healing process, and increased mortality. It requires that health professionals should provide support so patients quicker return to their usual life. Follow-up interviews with the staff after hospitalization in ICU have been shown to support the patient and identify individual needs and symptoms that can lead to more realistic expectations and increased well-being after admission in ICU. Follow-up in Denmark is being inconsistent in both the number of hospitals that offer this service, and in the offered type of service. Follow-up interviews with and without diaries suggest to improve physical and mental well-being and health, with limited scientific evidence of the efficacy of these interventions. We will investigate the effect of a standardized follow-up program after admission to the intensive care unit, consisting of written information, patient photos taken during hospitalization and three follow-up calls compared with standard care (discharge without follow-up).

During a clinical study conducted in several intensive care units in Denmark examined whether follow-up calls can improve patients' well-being and health, as well as the meaning of the follow-up program has on the patient's everyday life in the first year after hospitalization in the ICU.

The investigation contribute knowledge to the international research by revealing symptom burden and efficacy of a follow-up program for up to 1 year after admission to the ICU in order to be able to target rehabilitation efforts and improved the quality of life. It will be innovative to use the results from a clinical study as a foundation for a database, and the method can serve as a precedent for evidence-based introduction of guidelines, database registration and create the groundwork for future research in intensive care. This study is expected to be profitable to society by preventing frequent readmissions, reduce medication costs and fewer referrals to specialists and have a positive effect on retention to the labor market. This will provide overall better use of society's expenses.","NO","Intensive Care (ICU) Patients","OTHER: Standardized Followup program","Quality of Life, Changes over time in patients in the intervention and control group measured with instruments used and register data, corresponding to quality of life, on the mental component of the instrument, SF-36 Intension-to-treat analysis, 12 months","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,340,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: SUPPORTIVE_CARE","2012-12-01","2016-02","2016-10","2012-11-04","","2018-04-04","Department of Anaestesiology, Hillerod, 3400, Denmark","other"

"450","NCT03996057","Methenamine in a Non-antibiotic, Multimodal Approach to UTI Prevention","WITHDRAWN","Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common bacterial infection and are especially common in postmenopausal women, who often experience recurrent UTIs. Women with recurrent UTIs are commonly treated with antibiotics, but side effects, collateral damage to commensal bacteria, and antimicrobial resistance result from frequent antibiotic use. It is paramount that researchers develop non-antibiotic treatment strategies for UTIs.

Several non-antibiotic strategies may be successful in preventing recurrent UTIs in postmenopausal women, including low-dose vaginal estrogen, d-mannose, and methenamine hippurate. Methenamine hippurate (MH) is interesting as it causes few side effects, kills bacteria by denaturing bacterial proteins, RNA, and DNA, and does not develop resistance. Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of daily methenamine on the incidence of UTI. However, women often require multiple therapies in order to prevent recurrence. There are currently few guidelines to help clinicians identify optimal treatment regimens for non-antibiotic prevention of UTI.

The purpose of this pilot study is to examine the feasibility of developing a sequential, multiple assignment, randomization trial (SMART); and examine the treatment effect of MH in combination with vaginal estrogen (VET) and D-mannose on prevention of UTI. The investigators plan to examine the efficacy of the addition of MH to low dose VET and d-mannose in the UTI prevention through randomization to MH + VET + D-mannose vs continuing VET + D-mannose alone. The primary outcome will be the proportion of patients who have symptomatic, culture-proven UTI during a 3 month treatment period. The investigators hypothesize that women on low dose VET, d-mannose, and MH will be less likely to have recurrent UTI than those with VET and d-mannose alone.

This study uses a pragmatic, longitudinal approach that mimics patients' clinical experiences and physicians' decision points during management of UTI prophylaxis. Through this randomized, controlled pilot study, this proposal would allow the investigators to examine the feasibility of conducting a larger-scale, adaptive study trial, and estimate the treatment effect of a non-antibiotic regimen augmented with MH in women who continue to develop recurrence.","NO","UTI|Female Urogenital Diseases|UTI - Lower Urinary Tract Infection","DRUG: Methenamine Hippurate 1000 MG|DRUG: Vaginal estrogen|DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: D-mannose","Culture proven, symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI), Proportion of patients who have symptomatic, culture-proven UTI during a 3 month treatment period., 3 months|Recruitment rate, Proportion of patients approached who are eligible for the study and consent to participate vs those who do not agree to participate., Through study recruitment, an average of 1 year|Retention rate, Proportion of patients who finish the 3 months study versus those who are recruited, randomized, but do not complete the study., 3 months|Adherence, Average adherence to recommended dosage/frequency of vaginal estrogen, d-mannose, and methenamine hippurate use, as well as achievement of at least 75% adherence to medications., 3 months","FEMALE","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT","PHASE4",0,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: PREVENTION","2018-06-20","2022-02-11","2022-02-11","2019-06-24","","2022-07-08","","drug"

Despite a significant increase in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) utilisation, in particular acupuncture, as first or second-line treatment among local KOA patients, there exists a lack of high-quality evidence on its efficacy and local practice guidelines for TCM use in KOA tailored to our specific population demographic.

"462","NCT01506219","Geriatrician-performed Comprehensive Geriatric Care in an Outpatient Community Rehabilitation Unit","COMPLETED","Introduction:

Older adults with multiple illnesses represent the fastest growing sector of society and make increasing demands on all sectors of the health care system, particularly in outpatient community rehabilitation units due to shorter time of stay in acute care units and hospitals. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of geriatrician-performed comprehensive geriatric care (CGC) in older people referred to an outpatient community rehabilitation unit.

Methods:

The study is a prospective randomized controlled trial. Settings: two community care rehabilitation units in Aarhus Municipality, Denmark. Inclusion: persons aged 65 and older from home or hospital. Exclusion: persons who received palliative care or had been assessed by a geriatrician during the past month. Intervention: medical history, physical examination, blood tests, medication adjustment and related treatments performed by a geriatrician. Control: usual care in a community rehabilitation unit. Number of hospital admissions and emergency department (ED) visits (primary outcome), number of GP contacts, activities of daily living, physical and cognitive functioning, quality of life, data on institutionalization, medication status, and mortality are assessed at day 30 and 90 after arrival at the rehabilitation unit.

"465","NCT04998019","PositiveLinks: mHealth for DC Cohort","RECRUITING","To achieve the end of the HIV epidemic, concerted efforts will be needed to address the HIV care continuum, including improving retention in care (RIC) and viral suppression (VS) among persons with HIV (PWH). In the U.S., less than 50% of PWH are RIC and even fewer are VS. Studies have shown that these PWH have poorer clinical outcomes and are at risk of transmitting HIV to others, hence the need for innovative solutions to improve retention in care and subsequent viral suppression. Theory-based mHealth interventions have been shown to be promising in reaching these at-risk groups and improving HIV-related outcomes. PositiveLinks is a clinic-deployed mHealth platform that includes patient and provider smartphone apps, a web portal for clinic staff and providers to manage patient cohorts, an online implementation guide, and a learning management system to train and certify clinic staff. It has theory-based features including daily queries of adherence, mood, and stress, graphical feedback for self-monitoring, secure messaging with staff, appointment reminders, anonymized peer support, information resources, and document upload capability to support insurance re-enrollment. A 12-month prospective study in poorly retained PWH found that PL increased RIC and VS, with app use related to benefit as well as improved social support and stigma. PL is a promising existing mHealth tool for PWH, yet its efficacy has not been tested in a randomized trial, nor in urban populations. The investigators will test the efficacy of PositiveLinks to improve RIC and VS among a cohort of PWH in a high HIV prevalence city of Washington, DC. Participants will be identified from the DC Cohort, a longitudinal prospective cohort of PWH receiving HIV care at 15 clinics in DC. First, the investigators will conduct formative research to assess the feasibility, acceptability and usability of PositiveLinks among this urban cohort and conduct subsequent adaptations based on these findings. The investigators will then conduct an efficacy study through a cluster randomized controlled trial at 12 DC Cohort sites among 482 PWH. Clinics will be randomized to PL or usual care. Primary outcomes will include VS, RIC, and visit constancy at 12 months. Finally, the investigators will conduct mixed methods implementation science research guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research and RE-AIM to identify site, patient, provider, and system factors that characterize best practices in program implementation. If successful, this research will lead to the development of a novel and efficacious approach to improving RIC and VS among PWH which could lead to dissemination research that will contribute to HIV epidemic control. This project is responsive to NIH priorities, National HIV/AIDS Strategy, and Ending the HIV Epidemic goals as it is cross-cutting, seeks to reduce health inequities, and to improve health outcomes to achieve sustained viral suppression in a geographic hotspot for HIV.","NO","HIV/AIDS","BEHAVIORAL: PositiveLinks","Viral Suppression, Viral Suppression will be the nearest viral load measurement to the 12-month study time point for the participant, +/-90 days., Month 12 from baseline|Retention in Care, Retention in Care will be measured by Visit Constancy (i.e., proportion of 4-month time intervals with one visit with an HIV care provider completed in the 12-month time period of study participation), Month 12 from baseline|Retention in Care, Retention in Care will be measured by HRSA-1 (i.e.,keeping 2 HIV care appointments separated by 90 days within the 12-month time period of study participation), Month 12 from baseline","ALL","CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,753,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: OTHER","2022-12-12","2025-04-30","2025-06-30","2021-08-10","","2024-02-20","MetroHealth, Washington, District of Columbia, 20005, United States|Unity Medical Center, Washington, District of Columbia, 20005, United States|Georgetown University, Washington, District of Columbia, 20007, United States|La Clinica Del Pueblo, Washington, District of Columbia, 20009, United States|Children's National Medical Center Pediatric Clinic, Washington, District of Columbia, 20010, United States|Medstar Washington Hospital Center, Washington, District of Columbia, 20010, United States|Washington Health Institute, Washington, District of Columbia, 20017, United States|Family and Medical Counseling Service, Washington, District of Columbia, 20020, United States|Whitman-Walker Health, Washington, District of Columbia, 20036, United States|George Washington Medical Faculty Associates, Washington, District of Columbia, 20037, United States|Howard University Hospital Adult Clinic, Washington, District of Columbia, 20060, United States|Howard University Hospital Pediatric Clinic, Washington, District of Columbia, 20060, United States|Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Washington, District of Columbia, 20422, United States","behavioral"

"484","NCT04648436","Evaluation of Surgery in Elderly With Traumatic Acute SubDural Hematoma","WITHDRAWN","Rationale: The rapidly increasing number of elderly (≥ 65 years old) with traumatic brain injury (TBI) is accompanied by substantial medical and economic consequences. An intracranial hematoma, specifically an acute subdural hematoma (ASDH), is the most common injury in elderly with TBI. The surgical versus conservative treatment of this patient group remains an important clinical and moral dilemma, since it is in most cases unclear which treatment leads to a better outcome for the patient. Current guidelines are not based on high-quality evidence and compliance is low, allowing for large treatment variation in both Belgium and the Netherlands for patients with a traumatic ASDH. In addition, elderly are underrepresented in scientific TBI literature and are therefore not included in current guidelines or prognostic models, leading to major uncertainty in (neurosurgical) decision-making for this group. As participants in two large TBI research projects (CENTER-TBI, Net-QuRe), the investigators observe that the uncertainty regarding treatment of elderly with a traumatic ASDH will not be solved by the current ongoing studies. Therefore, they recognize the necessity of undertaking a prospective, randomized, multicenter trial on the (cost-)effectiveness of early surgical hematoma evacuation versus a conservative treatment in elderly with a traumatic ASDH.

Objective: To compare the (cost-)effectiveness of early surgical hematoma evacuation versus a conservative treatment in elderly patients with a traumatic ASDH.

Study design: A prospective, pragmatic, multicenter, randomized controlled trial (RCT).

Study population: Patients ≥ 65 years with at first presentation a GCS ≥ 9 and a traumatic ASDH \>10 mm or a traumatic ASDH \<10 mm and a midline shift \>5 mm, or a GCS \< 9 with a traumatic ASDH \<10 mm and a midline shift \<5 mm without extracranial explanations for the comatose state, for whom clinical equipoise exists regarding the preferred treatment.

Intervention: Patients are randomized to either early surgical hematoma evacuation (A) or conservative management on the ICU or the ward (B). In case of neurological deterioration during conservative management, delayed surgery can be performed. The exact neurosurgical technique will be left to the discretion of the surgeons.

Main study parameters/endpoints: Functional outcome after 1 year, expressed by the rating on the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E) Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: Both treatment strategies are already used in current clinical practice as standard medical care. Therefore, there are no extra risks for patients participating in the study compared to patients outside the study. Study participation adds a minimal burden of three follow-up evaluations by visit in the first year (at 3, 6 and 12 months) and subsequent yearly evaluations by phone or postal until five years after the injury. Future elderly patients with a traumatic ASDH will benefit mostly from this study's results.","NO","Intracranial Hemorrhages|Surgery","OTHER: Early neurosurgical hematoma evacuation|OTHER: Conservative treatment (best medical management)","Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOS-E), scale of functional outcome ranging from 1-8 in which a higher score reflects a better recovery, 1 year","ALL","OLDER_ADULT",NA,0,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT","2022-03-01","2023-03-23","2023-03-23","2020-12-01","","2023-06-26","Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC), Leiden, Zuid Holland, 2333ZA, Netherlands","other"

The second objective is to examine the additional costs of the telehealth solution and assess whether this solution is a cost-effective way to care for patients with Heart Failure across patients and municipality districts.

It is hypothesized that telehealth care will increase patients quality adjusted life years compared to usual practice, since no difference in mortality and a higher health related quality of life is expected. Furthermore, it is hoped that there will be a 30% reduction in the number of admissions and readmissions to hospitals and a 30% reduction in the number of outpatient visits resulting in fewer costs for hospitals.

"499","NCT05676541","Enhanced Care for Patients With Complex Multimorbidity in Primary Care","NOT_YET_RECRUITING","Introduction Patients living with a chronic disease often have more than one chronic condition, which is referred to as multimorbidity. Multimorbidity is associated with decreased quality of life, functional decline, polypharmacy, and increased healthcare utilization. Patients with multimorbidity often have a high symptom- and treatment burden, and have to attend multiple appointments, often at numerous locations, and comply with complex or even conflicting advice and drug regimens, resulting in an increased risk of depression and low quality of life. In Denmark, general practice is the key organizational setting in terms of offering people with complex multimorbidity integrated, longitudinal, patient-centered care. However, caring for patients with multimorbidity is a complex and time-consuming task and the organization of chronic care in general practice is organized around individual conditions.

Research question The objective of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a complex intervention consisting of a prolonged consultation and a strengthened cross-sectoral collaboration for patients with complex multimorbidity listed in participating practices on the patients' health-related quality of life, health and use of health-services.

"504","NCT00462241","Treatment Study Comparing Manual Treatment or Advice in Acute, Musculoskeletal Chest Pain","COMPLETED","Acute chest pain is a common cause of hospital admission. Active approaches are directed towards diagnosis and treatment of potentially life threatening conditions, especially acute coronary syndrome and coronary artery disease. However, a considerable number of patients may have chest pain caused by biomechanical dysfunction of muscles and joints of the chest wall or the cervical and thoracic spine (20%). The diagnostic approaches and treatment options for this group of patients are scarce and there is a lack of formal clinical studies and validated outcome measures addressing the effect of manual treatment approaches.

Objective: This single blind randomized clinical trial investigates whether chiropractic treatment can reduce pain and improve function in a population of patients with acute, musculoskeletal chest pain when compared to advice directed towards promoting self-management.

Methods: Among patients admitted to a chest pain clinic in a university hospital under suspicion of acute coronary syndrome, 120 patients with an episode of acute chest pain of musculoskeletal origin are included in the study. All patients have completed the chest pain clinic diagnostic procedures, and acute coronary syndrome and other obvious reasons for chest pain have been excluded. After completion of the study evaluation program, the patients are randomized into one of two groups: A) advice promoting self-management and individual instructions focusing on posture and muscle stretch; B) a course of chiropractic therapy of up to ten treatment sessions focusing on high velocity, low amplitude manipulation of the cervical and thoracic spine together with a choice of mobilisation and soft tissue techniques. In order to establish suitable outcome measures, two pilot studies were conducted. Outcome measures are pain, function, overall health, and patient-rated treatment effect measured at 4, 12, and 52 weeks following treatment.","NO","Musculoskeletal Chest Pain|Non-cardiac Chest Pain|Undiagnosed Chest Pain","PROCEDURE: chiropractic treatment|OTHER: Self-management","Worst chest pain during the last week., 7 days|Patient-rated outcomes regarding improvement in chest pain., 4 weeks","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,115,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT","2006-08","2008-03","2008-03","2007-04-18","","2013-02-20","Dept. of Cardiology and Dept. of Nuclear Medicine, Odense University Hospital, Odense, DK-5000, Denmark","procedure"

"507","NCT06305819","Effectiveness of a Self-management Program After Traumatic Injury","RECRUITING","Traumatic injuries, defined as a physical injury with sudden onset, are a leading cause to disability and impaired health. Persons who sustain a traumatic injury often report problems in daily life activities and reduced quality of life, which may limit participation in work/studies, leisure activities and family life. Consequently, complex rehabilitation and support is recommended in National Trauma guidelines due to the often long-lasting physical and psychological sequela of the injury.

The main goal of this study is to determine the effectiveness of a self-management support program delivered to persons with a moderate or severe traumatic injury in the sub-acute phase of recovery (i.e. 3-4 months after injury). The self-management program aims to enhance patients' self-efficacy by building skills and self-management strategies to cope with injury-related consequences. The program has a group-based format and consists of eight sessions comprising psychoeducation, skill mastery and sharing of experiences. The participants who will be included in the study must be between 18 and 70 years, be residing in the southeast region of Norway, be admitted to Oslo University hospital or transferred from local hospital within 72 hours after injury, have at least a two-day hospital stay, and be able to read and understand Norwegian language. Participants will be randomly assigned to either intervention or control group.

Literature reviews suggest that over 60% of survivors have reproductive health problems yet fewer than 20% get professional help. This study will test the uptake, use and effectiveness of online, interactive self-help programs for men and women with cancer. Participants in the study will receive up to 6 months of access to the self-help programs without charge. Navigation through the programs can be personalized by setting goals and following links to the most relevant information. The programs cover all cancer sites and common treatments, explaining sexual and fertility side effects. Programs also include step-by-step cognitive behavioral self-help exercises, guidance on available medical treatment options, decision aids, and video stories with actual survivors as well as vignettes with actors. Information for same-sex couples is included. Programs include suggestions on how partners can work together to cope with sexual or fertility issues.

The primary hypothesis is that participants will report improvements in sexual function and satisfaction from baseline to 3-month follow-up. Secondary hypotheses will investigate whether more extensive use of the program is associated with better outcomes (dose-response effect) and whether the intervention also improves secondary outcomes such as anxiety, depression, relationship satisfaction, and seeking medical help. Analyses from the data will investigate how many people who are informed of the study decide to participate (uptake), as well as how often participants visit the program and which parts are used most. Both the male and female programs have previously been shown to help cancer survivors and partners in published clinical trials.

To improve older adults' quality of life and to reduce negative outcomes is necessary to provide appropriate care at affordable costs. To achieve this goal and to address the most effective intervention, stratification by frailty and negative outcomes is needed. Another crucial point to older adults is social isolation, this is related to the extension and quality of life of the individual's relationship network. Social isolation, as well as the level of frailty, are associated with an increased risk of death, hospitalization, and institutionalization.

Results: Analysis of data collected in the Lazio region during the pre-intervention phase is finished. Total patients enrolled are 1185 (578 cases and 607 control). The intervention is focused on increasing social capital at the individual and community level and aimed at improving survival among the cases as well as reducing the use of hospital and residential Long-Term Care.

Conclusions: The proposed study will address a crucial issue: assess the impact of a bottom-up care service consisting of social and health interventions aimed at reducing social isolation and improving access to health care services. The results of the study will be shared in the country, to reach the larger spread and to direct the policymaker.

Objective: The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of a community-based proactive monitoring program. This study aims to improve community care by measuring the effect in countering the negative outcomes related to the frailty of older adults (over 80).

"520","NCT04385264","#StayHome: Early Hydroxychloroquine to Reduce Secondary Hospitalisation and Household Transmission in COVID-19","SUSPENDED","BACKGROUND Despite drastic quarantine measures, COVID-19 continues to propagate and threatens global healthcare systems by saturating their capacity with high transmissibility and the particularly protracted length of stay needed by those requiring intensive care. Indeed, once patients advance to the ICU, prognosis is poor and it is thus critical to test medications that may prevent complications and reduce viral shedding. i.e. to protect ambulatory patients and their families from complications and transmission and allow them to #StayHome.

To date, no treatment has been reliably demonstrated as effective in COVID-19 patients.

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), a common and well tolerated medication, has shown promise in vitro for reducing viral replication (for SARS-CoV-2 as well as other coronaviruses with pandemic potential such as SARS-CoV-1 and MERS). Since then, several small-scale hospital-based clinical studies have indicated the potential for reduced viral shedding and hospitalisation as well as favourable evolution of lung pathology. If started earlier, this treatment could prevent complications requiring hospitalisation and intensive care, which may not be available in low-income countries.

Robust clinical trials are required to assess the potential of HCQ in COVID-19.

OBJECTIVES This trial assesses the efficacy of early treatment with HCQ in COVID-19 outpatients to reduce the incidence and severity of complications including secondary hospitalisation, ICU admissions, lung pathology and death. Secondarily, this trial will also assess its efficacy to reduce viral transmission among household contacts during self-quarantine. The clinical data collected in this trial will also be critical in creating early prognostication models to better predict healthcare needs and have evidence-based prioritization of resource allocation, which is especially critical in low-resource settings.

METHODS The trial will recruit 800 SARS-CoV-2+ patients and their household contacts at triage sites across Switzerland. Patients included are 1) at risk of poor outcome (comorbidities or \>65y) and 2) well enough to self-isolate at home. These patients will be randomised 1:1 in HCQ:Placebo and given 6 days of early treatment (within 24 hours of the SARS-CoV-2 test). Intensive pragmatic multiparameter at-home follow-up (including point-of-care lung ultrasound in some sites) will continue until their outcome (resolution, or complications, such as hospitalisation, ICU admission, death). Household contacts will have before and after serological testing and social distancing knowledge and practices questionnaires to assess risk factors for infections. The household attack rate of new-onset infections can then assess the efficacy of HCQ to prevent transmission.","NO","COVID-19","DRUG: Hydroxychloroquine|DRUG: Mannitol","Proportion of poor outcomes (in index cases), Proportion of secondary hospitalisations (and their length), ICU admissions (and their length) and deaths., During the period that the subject is considered as COVID-19-positive: Average of 11 days","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT","PHASE2|PHASE3",800,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT","2022-01","2022-08","2022-12","2020-05-12","","2021-05-11","Unisanté, Lausanne, Vaud, 1015, Switzerland","drug"
"521","NCT05249790","Anti-inflammatory Drug Algorithm for COVID-19 Home Treatment","UNKNOWN","The newly recognised disease COVID-19 is caused by the Severe-AcuteRespiratory-Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which rapidly spread globally in late 2019, reaching pandemic proportions. The clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection is broad, encompassing asymptomatic infection, mild upper respiratory tract illness and mild extrapulmonary symptoms, and severe viral pneumonia with respiratory failure and even death.

For COVID-19, most primary care physicians have initially treated their patients according to their judgment, with various treatment regimens they believe are most appropriate based on their experience/expertise. We recently published a note on how we were treating patients at home based on the pathophysiology underlining the mild/moderate symptoms at the onset of the illness and the proposal of simple drugs that theoretically better fir these mechanisms.

Because the common early mild symptoms of COVID-19 highlight a systemic inflammatory process, there is the recommendation of using anti-inflammatory agents to limit excessive host inflammatory responses to the viral infection, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and corticosteroids. Moreover, COVID-19 patients are exposed to the risk of thromboembolic events and anticoagulant prophylaxis is recommended even at home, in particular settings, unless contraindicated.

In an academic matched-cohort study, we found that early treatment of COVID-19 patients at home by their family doctors according to the proposed recommendation regimen almost completely prevented the need for hospital admission (the most clinically relevant outcome of the study along with death) due to progression toward more severe illness (2 out of 90 patients), compared to patients in the 'control' cohort who were treated at home according to their family physician's assessments (13 out of 90 patients). However, the rate of hospitalization was a secondary outcome of the study and the possibility of a casual finding cannot be definitely excluded. Moreover, these findings were achieved in a retrospective observational study with two matched cohorts of COVID-19 patients, a possible additional limitation of the robustness of the conclusions that would deserve further validation. Thus, we have considered the observed reduction in patient hospitalization a hypothesis generating finding to be confirmed.

In this pragmatic, prospective, three-months, cluster randomized, open-label, blinded endpoint (PROBE) clinical trial, we will compare two groups of family doctors according to a randomized approach, who will treat their COVID19-patients with the proposed recommendation algorithm or other treatment regimens they normally feel appropriate according to their usual clinical practice, and monitor them longitudinally up to 3 months.

Our working hypothesis is that following the proposed recommendation algorithm the early COVID-19-related inflammatory process is limited, preventing the need of hospital admission at larger extent than with other therapeutic approaches also targeting early symptoms of the illness at home.

Should the findings be confirmed, the tested standardized treatment protocol would achieve major benefits for patients with early COVID-19 in particular in relation to a remarkably reduced risk of hospitalization that is expected to translate into reduced morbility and, possibly, mortality. Notably, these expected clinical benefits would be associated with remarkably reduced treatment costs related to reduced hospitalization.","NO","COVID-19","DRUG: Recommended treatment schedule|DRUG: Usual care","Proportion of patients who reach score ≥ 5 of Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS), an index of the need of hospitalization in the two treatment groups., From beginning the proposed recommended treatments or other therapeutic regimens, assessed up to 90 days.","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT","PHASE3",1800,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT","2022-04","2023-04","2023-04","2022-02-22","","2022-03-09","","drug"

Outcome measures of interest are shoulder-related disability reported by the patients, shoulder pain and shoulder stiffness. These outcome parameters will be compared between both treatment arms with an intention-to-treat analysis.

In fact, the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) identified an 11% increase in ED wait times from 2015-2016 to 2016-2017. This translates to long wait times that deter patients from pursuing necessary care and increases their likelihood of leaving without being seen by an ED physician. In Newfoundland and Labrador (NL), this issue has precipitated strikingly serious situations regarding long wait times that have made the province a case-in-point for ED issues. To counter this, the investigators propose an innovative quality-improvement intervention called SurgeCon that includes a protocol-driven software platform and several other initiatives to reduce wait times and improve the sustainability of health systems without significant workforce changes.

In 2016, 59% of NH residents were severely dependent in their activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) according to the French scale Autonomie, Gérontologie Groupe Iso Ressources, (1 the most dependant to 6 the less dependent); the majority of these most dependent NH residents (80% of Groupe Iso-Ressource 1-2 in 2011) had at least one unstable chronic pathology and 73% of deceased residents (in 2015) come from this group whose level of dependence is very high.

Palliative care (PC), which is care focused on maintaining quality of life in a context of incurable and complex pathology, therefore appears to be indicated in the context of NH. However, residents' access to PC remains limited, uneven and late. The number of residents requiring this support is estimated at more than 100,000 residents per year. The consequences of such situation are serious, first with regard to the quality of life of NH residents and their family caregivers, but also the inappropriate use of health services (as shown by the excessive use of emergency department and unscheduled hospitalizations) and work life for care providers in NH is affected (care providers suffer from a lack of support when faced with the difficulties of caring for NH residents at the end of their life). However, these consequences are potentially avoidable by means of adapted organizational solutions. The implementation of an integrated and early palliative approach (IEPA) in care pathway of patient is one of the solutions recommended by the World Health Organization and the French National Authority for Health. Several studies have shown the benefit of such approach in the management of cancer patients. However, the transferability and effectiveness of this approach in other organizational and population contexts are poorly documented, particularly in NH settings.

The main objective is to evaluate, through a pragmatic controlled trial the effectiveness of an Early Integrated Palliative Care Approach in usual NH context (EIPCA-NH) on the quality of care in NH for elderly in need of PC. The secondary objectives concern:

1. the implementation process of the EIPCA-NH: i) measure the degree of implementation of the EIPCA-NH in each site, ii) identify and understand the factors (individual and organizational) facilitating or limiting the success of the implementation process of an IEPA according to NH contexts (inter-site comparison).
2. the effects of the EIPCA-NH in the NH : i) on the quality of life of residents requiring PC and ii) that of their family caregivers, iii) on the quality work life of professional caregivers and iv) on the care pathway of NH residents.

A mixed methods research, with qualitative and quantitative approach, will be carried out in at least 20 NH in three different health territories. These NH will benefit from a EIPCA-NH intervention which consists of 1) implementing a mechanism for sharing and co-producing knowledge, 2) integrating this approach as early as possible in the care of residents. This study is based on a multicenter, randomized crossover cluster-type stepped-wedge study, running on 4 years in order to measure the sustainability of EIPCA-NH; the quantitative analysis of the effectiveness of EIPCA-NH will focus on an open cohort of 3,500 residents receiving the intervention. The qualitative component will consist of a multiple case study to analyse the process of implementation and production of the EIPCA-NH. The integrative analysis of qualitative and quantitative data will allow a better understanding of the causal mechanisms of the observed phenomena.

This project will provide evidence on the value of EIPCA and the conditions for its implementation and transferability. The proposed intervention will help improve care practices for all NH residents (600,000 people). The approach by co-construction between actors of the thousands of care structures (NH, cities, hospitals) and researchers should promote a better representation of PC, promote the culture of anticipation, evaluation and collaboration between actors of in- and out- NH, contributing to a better synergy of intersectoral and territorial actions of the supply of health services.","NO","Palliative Care|Nursing Homes|Aged","OTHER: early integrated palliative approach model","Change in the number of resident with access to palliative care assessed by the proactive identification guidance and by the InterRAI Palliative Care assessment system, stepped-wedge with 4 clusters, Quantitative data will be collected throughout study completion (up to 2 years), each nursing home will have evaluations following a stepped-wedge design with 4 time periods: Pre-implantation, Implantation, Post implantation, Sustainability","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,3500,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","2021-03-30","2021-03-30","2023-08-31","2021-01-13","","2021-06-07","Ch Avignon, Avignon, France|Maison de Santé Marie Galène, Bordeaux, France|Maison Médicale Jeanne Garnier, Paris, France","other"

Physical activity (PA) can attenuate these negative effects and improve quality of life (QoL). However, most cancer survivors fail to perform/sustain adequate PA levels, especially in the long-term. Theory-based interventions, using evidence-based behavior change techniques, aimed at promoting long-term behavior change in breast cancer survivors are effective, but remain scarce and fail to promote self-regulatory skills and better-quality motivations associated with sustained PA adoption.

PAC-WOMAN will test the long-term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of two state of the art, group-based interventions encouraging sustained changes in PA, sedentary behavior, and QoL. Additional aims include examining the impact of both interventions on secondary outcomes (eg, body composition, physical function), and key moderators/mediators of short and long-term changes in primary outcomes. A 3-arm pragmatic randomized controlled trial, involving a 4-month intervention and a 12-month follow-up, will be implemented, in a real exercise setting, to compare: 1) brief PA counseling/motivational intervention; 2) structured exercise program vs. waiting-list control group.

"548","NCT05718102","Pragmatic Trial to Enhance Quality Safety, and Patient Experience in COPD","RECRUITING","Background: Over 26 million Americans have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is the third leading cause of death in the United States. Unfortunately, few patients receive proven therapies and many receive therapies known to have safer alternatives. One major reason is the competing demands of primary care providers (PCPs) who manage 90% of patients with COPD. The research team has developed a population management approach where pulmonary specialists provide evidence-based recommendations as an E-consult with unsigned orders to PCPs. PCPs can then quickly review the E-consult and sign, modify, or discontinue these orders. The investigators found this intervention led to marked improvements in the quality-of-care delivered and patients' COPD-related quality-of-life. While promising, this approach is limited by a paucity of pulmonary providers nationwide. Clinical pharmacists are 20 times more prevalent as pulmonary specialists and some regions of VA (VISN 17, COPD Cares) have assigned clinical pharmacists a role in the management of patients with COPD. However, the relative effectiveness of pharmacist-led management is yet to be established.

Study Description: This study tests population management for COPD provided by pharmacists relative to pulmonary specialists. The investigators are conducting a cluster randomized clinical trial at five medical centers and their associated clinics within the Department of Veterans Affair. Study staff will randomize PCPs to population management conducted by either pulmonary specialists or pharmacists. Within PCPs' panels, study staff will use VA electronic health record to identify patients with evidence of COPD. Pulmonologists and pharmacists will review these patients and provide guideline-based recommendations to PCPs. Pulmonary specialists and pharmacists will then deliver evidence-based recommendations through E-consults coupled with unsigned orders for primary care providers to sign, modify or decline.

Outcomes: Investigators will assess if proactive, population management recommendations by clinical pharmacists and pulmonary specialists lead to non-inferior outcomes for patients with COPD. The primary outcome will be a composite endpoint of COPD exacerbation, pneumonia, hospitalization, or death six month after intervention. Secondary outcomes will include 1) the proportion of guideline recommended therapies received by patients, 2) COPD-related quality-of-life as measured by the Clinical COPD Questionnaire, and 3) PCP acceptance of recommendations, and 4) each individual outcome within the primary composite endpoint above.","NO","Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive","OTHER: Population-health management","Proportion of patients with COPD exacerbation, pneumonia, hospitalization, or Death (composite outcome), 6 months after intervention","ALL","CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,4000,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","2023-05-16","2027-01-01","2027-01-01","2023-02-08","","2023-06-15","Minneapolis VA Health Care System, Minneapolis, Minnesota, 55417, United States|Portland VA Medical Center, Portland, Oregon, 97239, United States|Ralph H.

"558","NCT01961284","Zygomatic Versus Conventional Dental Implants in Augmented Maxillae","WITHDRAWN","Dental implants are used for replacing missing teeth. Placing dental implants is limited by the presence of adequate bone volume permitting their anchorage. In order to solve this problem several bone augmentation procedures have been developed. In principle the missing bone is taken from a donor site (for example the hip), transplanted where needed and then implants are placed. Sometimes, major bone grafting operations have to be undertaken under general anaesthesia requiring patients to be hospitalised for a few days. Some degree of morbidity related to the donor site must be expected, though more recently bone substitutes are used to minimize morbidity, and 2 to 3 surgical interventions may be needed before the implants can be functionally used. Sometimes patients have to wait more than 1 year before a prosthesis can be fixed to the implants and the total cost of the treatment is high. At the beginning of the 1990s a long screwshaped implant was developed by Professor PI Brånemark as an alternative to bone augmentation procedures: the zygomatic implant. Zygomatic implants are generally inserted through the palate to engage the body of the cheek bone. One to three zygomatic implants can be inserted through the posterior palate to engage the body of each cheek bone. The potential main advantages of zygomatic implants could be that bone grafting may not be needed and a fixed prosthesis could be fitted the same day of their placement. Despite that zygomatic implants have been used for more than 20 years, their effectiveness has never been compared with conventional dental implants in augmented maxillae. The aim of the project is to compare the longtermclinical outcome of fullarch upper jaw bridges supported by zygomatic implants versus conventional implants placed in augmented bone in the palate.","NO","Edentulous Maxilla|Resorbed Maxilla|Implant Therapy","DEVICE: Zygomatic implant placement|DEVICE: conventional implants and augmentation of maxilla","Implant success, Implant failure is defined by implant mobility +/- infection dictating implant removal., 1 year following implant loading|Implant success, Implant failure is defined by implant mobility +/- infection dictating implant removal, 3 years following implant loading|Implant success, Implant failure is defined by implant mobility +/- infection dictating implant removal., 5 years after implant loading|Implant Success, Implant failure is defined by implant mobility +/- infection dictating implant removal, 7 years after implant loading|Implant Success, Implant failure is defined by implant mobility +/- infection dictating implant removal, 10 years after implant loading|Implant success, Implant failure is defined by implant mobility +/- infection dictating implant removal, 15 years after implant loading","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,0,"OTHER_GOV","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT","2013-10","2017-08","2017-08","2013-10-11","","2017-09-25","Glasgow Dental Hospital and School, Glasgow, United Kingdom|St John's Hospital, Livingston, United Kingdom","device"

"567","NCT02341690","Intervention Study - Effectiveness of Smartphone Delivered Interval Walking Training to Patients With Type 2 Diabetes","COMPLETED","Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) is one of the most common chronic diseases world vide. Patients with T2D experiences reduced quality of life and have a lower physical activity level. Physical activity is well documented treatment to the patient group. The effect of physical activity is shown to reduce co-morbidity, and better functional level and quality of life.

Interval Walking Training (IWT) is a new and effective exercise type. IWT is done by walking in a slow and a fast tempo. InterWalk is an application to a smartphone. By using InterWalk the patient can to IWT independently and when used, the app has, as an exercise tool, the potential to better the individual functional level and to measure the physical activity level with the integrated personalised walking test.

Motivation for change of habits and lifestyle is subjectively determined by the individual, his or hers individual resources and environment. It is important to get insight in these individual challenges in order to be better structure possible help.

The combination of an exercise log, a measure of physical activity fromInterWalk and insight in motivational aspects on an individual level, is essential for successful individualised training.

The primary objective of the study is to investigate if the InterWalk app is more effective in increasing the physical activity level compared to a standard care offer in a sample of newly T2D diabetes patients across 52 weeks.

Secondarily, we will investigate if the IW app can reduce sitting time, induce weight loss, improve glycaemic control, increase quality of life, improve cardio-respiratory fitness and reduce the use of diabetes medication.

The study is designed to test the hypothesis that replacing a standard exercise program in the normal municipal standard care with the Interval Walking Training delivered by the IW app with and without a motivational support program, can increase the long-term physical activity level in patients with T2D for a period of 52 weeks.

From January 2015 to June 2016 all patient's with T2D, who are referred to the promotion centres in the municipality, will be offered to participate in the study. In total 513 patients with T2D from different municipalities in Denmark will be included and randomly allocated into three groups. One group will receive standard care and the two other groups will do IWT with the InterWalk app. All three groups are followed by the promotion centre for 8-14 weeks (according to the rehabilitation in the municipality) and hereafter only one of the IWT groups will receive motivational support up to 52 weeks.

All patients, no mater group allocation, will be tested and fulfill questionnaires, three times during the intervention period - at baseline, after 8-14 weeks and after 52 weeks.

"568","NCT02892864","Virtual Rehabilitation Program in Peripheral Facial Paralysis","TERMINATED","Facial palsy can be divided into supranuclear lesion (central facial palsy) and infranuclear lesion such as Bell's Palsy, an idiopathic disease. The peripheral facial paralysis (PFP) is a frequent but little-known pathology (20 / 100 000 inhabitants in France a year). Oro-facial functions and the ability to convey emotional facial information are seriously affected by facial palsy, thereby reducing patient's quality of life. The PFP can have several repercussions on the functional, aesthetic, social, occupational and psychological levels. Evolution and prognosis depend not only on its etiology and gravity, but also on the precocity and the quality of the medical and paramedical care. It is essential to assess functional and psychological issues before beginning an adapted global therapeutic care. If these depressive symptoms can be explained by multiple factors, the inability to smile would be one of the triggering factors of depression. The facial feedback hypothesis could be one of many explications because smiling induces a positive emotional state and a feeling of well-being. In PFP, patients must cope with their difficulties to smile. Their facial behaviour affected their own emotional experiences.

The main purpose of the present study is to determine if virtual rehabilitation program is relevant compared to standard therapy. The second aim is to characterize the efficiency by analysing the time required to obtain a stable score of 4 in the Sunnybrook test. A secondary objective will be to decrease the functional and social repercussions of the facial paralysis with an intensive and targeted therapy of the smile. Furthermore, a virtual rehabilitation program will be implemented in an interactive platform.

To this end, a parallel randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the two groups will be conducted: standard therapy versus virtual rehabilitation program. RCT involves a treatment in which active participation of the patient is necessary so only the assessment will be blinded. Facial motor skills (tongue, mouth and face motricity) are measured using electronic devices, objective and subjective evaluation with pragmatic fields such as communication, emotion and quality of life. The severity of patient's facial paralysis is appraised by the House and Brackmann scale. This global assessment will be conducted before the beginning of the therapy and every 3 months during 18 months.

The patients will be recruited within the Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT) service after a baseline assessment. Simple randomization will be used in order to establish both therapeutic groups with 45 patients in each group.

Group A: Patients taken care in consultation within the ENT service which provides oro-myo-functional classical rehabilitation.

Group B: Patients taken care in external consultation who receive oro-myo-functional rehabilitation through a virtual rehabilitation program targeted at the smile, in their place of living in virtual conditions.

The patients must have been diagnosed with unilateral peripheral facial palsy, according to House and Brackmann international classification.

Inclusion time : 18 months

Between-two-groups analysis will be conducted in order to compare a targeted and intensive implementation-intention rehabilitation such as virtual rehabilitation program to standard therapy.

"571","NCT02578979","Serial ECG Versus Holter to Detect Atrial Fibrillation in Elderly Ischemic Stroke Patients","COMPLETED","Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is often undetected because characteristics such as short duration, episodic, and frequently asymptomatic nature make it challenging to diagnose at the bedside, leading to suboptimal secondary prevention. It is not uncommon for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation to be undetected in a single electrocardiogram (ECG) on admission. Conventional 24-hour Holter monitoring is often used to detect paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. However, systematic review suggests Holter monitoring will identify atrial fibrillation in only an additional 4.6% of patients, no better than detection rates observed in groups lacking routine monitoring. On the other hand, for ischemic stroke patients with sinus rhythm at baseline but paroxysmal atrial fibrillation still suspected, no recommendation beyond repeated 12-lead ECGs is made in the United Kingdom guideline. Serial 12-lead ECG has been used to detect possible paroxysmal atrial fibrillation among acute ischemic stroke patients and found 15 new cases of atrial fibrillation in 133 acute ischemic stroke patients (11.3%) without atrial fibrillation at baseline. The optimal investigation strategy, including modality, duration of investigation, and patient subgroup remains undefined, not only for efficacy in the detection of atrial fibrillation, but also cost-effectiveness in healthcare systems. The objective of this project is to conduct a pragmatic multicenter randomized controlled trial for the comparison of serial 12-lead ECG once daily for 5 days and 24-hour Holter to detect paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in acute ischemic stroke patients without atrial fibrillation identified by baseline ECG or history.","NO","Ischemic Stroke","DEVICE: Electrocardiogram|DEVICE: Holter","Number of atrial fibrillation detected, within 3 month of stroke onset","ALL","OLDER_ADULT",NA,826,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: DIAGNOSTIC","2015-10-01","2018-07-31","2018-10-31","2015-10-19","","2019-07-08","Chia-yi Christian Hospital, Chiayi City, 600, Taiwan|Dalin Tzu Chi General Hospital, Dalin, 622, Taiwan|Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Keelung Branch, Keelung, 204, Taiwan|Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Chiayi Branch, Puzih, 613, Taiwan|National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei City, 100, Taiwan|Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkuo Branch, Taoyuan, 333, Taiwan","device"

"573","NCT05747079","Immediate Versus Optional Delayed Surgical Repair for Treatment of Acute ACL Injuries","RECRUITING","Currently, most patients with an anterior cruciate ligament injury undergo surgery. There is a general belief that surgical reconstruction is necessary to safely return to sports and to prevent early knee osteoarthritis or additional meniscus injuries. But there is insufficient scientific evidence to support this belief. Moreover, several studies show that surgical reconstruction of the cruciate ligament does not guarantee successful return to sports or the prevention of osteoarthritis and secondary meniscus injuries. Therefore, immediate surgery after an anterior cruciate ligament injury is questioned. So far, only two RCTs (KANON study and COMPARE study) have assessed this, and they could not show that immediate reconstruction is an added value (in terms of symptoms, knee function, activity level, osteoarthritis or additional meniscal injuries) compared to a conservative approach consisting of rehabilitation and late surgery for persistent knee instability.

Therefore, this additional multicenter RCT, aims to 1) verify these results and 2) to identify predictors that predict which patients in the conservative group will not require late surgery. This has not been investigated to date. It is suspected that factors such as symptoms, strength, findings on the MRI scan and psychological factors may play a role in whether or not a patient will be able to successfully rehabilitate without surgical repair.

This information is invaluable to physicians because it allows them to decide which treatment is best for the patient.","NO","ACL Injury","OTHER: Rehabilitation|PROCEDURE: Optional delayed anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction|PROCEDURE: Immediate anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction","Clinical effectiveness (long-term), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score - Subscale Quality of Life (score between 0-100, higher scores mean better outcome), 12 months post-injury|Clinical effectiveness (short-term), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score - Subscale Quality of Life (score between 0-100, higher scores mean better outcome), 7 months post-injury","ALL","CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,280,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT","2023-03-02","2026-03-02","2028-03-02","2023-02-28","","2023-11-13","UZ Leuven, Leuven, 3000, Belgium","other"

Currently, the Pilates method has shown to be effective in improving pain and disability in patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP). However, there is still no evidence about the ideal number of sessions for the treatment and the interval between sessions to achieve better efficacy of this method for these patients. Thus, the aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of the Pilates method with different weekly frequency of sessions in the treatment of patients with nonspecific CLBP. Investigators will assess 296 patients of both genders, with nonspecific CLBP lasting more than three months and aged between 18 and 80 years. Participants will be randomly divided into four groups (n = 74 patients per group): Control Group will receive an educational booklet and no additional exercise, Pilates 1 Group will receive a program of exercises based on Pilates method once a week for six weeks, Pilates 2 Group will receive the same program of exercises twice a week for six weeks and Pilates 3 Group will receive the same program of exercises three times a week for six weeks.

Common bile duct gallstones (CBDS) are found in 3.4% to 18% of patients undergoing cholecystectomy. A two-step approach including endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) with stone extraction and papillotomy with subsequent laparoscopic cholecystectomy has become gold standard for treatment of CBDS in Denmark. However, ERC is associated with a high risk of complications and more than 50% of patients require multiple ERCs. Recent meta analyses find that a one-step approach might be superior in terms of safety, CBDS clearance rate, hospital stay, operative time, hospital cost and stone recurrence, but much more data is needed.

The preGallstep trial is an investigator-initiated multicentre randomised clinical pilot trial with blinded outcome assessment investigating a novel one-step laparoscopic cholecystectomy with common bile duct exploration and stone extraction versus conventional two-step endoscopic retrograde cholangiography with stone extraction plus a subsequent laparoscopic cholecystectomy for patients with CBDS. After enrolment, the participant will be randomised to one of the two treatment approaches. Adult patients with imaging confirmed CBDS are eligible for inclusion.

"586","NCT05061108","Linkage, Empowerment, and Access to Prevent Hypertension","RECRUITING","Brief Summary:

Black adults have a higher incidence of hypertension (HTN) and a greater risk of HTN-related cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared with White adults. Even mild elevations in blood (BP) above 115/75 mm Hg are associated with increased CVD risk. Accordingly, emphasis is being placed on early interventions for high BP, particularly in those who are low cardiovascular risk(systolic BP 110-139 and diastolic BP \< 90 mm Hg), for participants lifestyle modification is recommended. Although lifestyle modifications are effective to lower BP, implementation is suboptimal in Black communities, especially those participants residing in low-income urban settings. Pervasive negative social determinants of health (SDoH), such as poor access to healthcare, food insecurity, limited availability of healthy foods, lack of safe places to engage in physical activity, and low health literacy are major drivers of inequities in HTN and a critical barrier to implementation of recommended lifestyle modifications in Black communities. To achieve health equity, effective strategies must address negative SDoH that are root causes of racial disparities in health outcomes as clearly demonstrated by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Predominantly Black cities like Detroit, Michigan, where the mortality rate from heart disease is nearly twice the national average, have been devastated by COVID-19. To address this, the investigators developed an innovative mobile health unit (MHU) program that uses geospatial health and social vulnerability data to direct deployment of testing and vaccination services to communities with highest needs. Since April 2020, the investigators conducted 500 events with 220 community partners where 40,000 people have been tested or vaccinated for COVID in MHUs.

Using a hybrid type I effectiveness-implementation design in the proposed Linkage, Empowerment, and Access to Prevent Hypertension (LEAP-HTN) study, the investigators will implement a novel approach that links low cardiovascular risk Black adult participants without stage-2 hypertension to collaborative care delivered in deprived neighborhoods by community health workers (CHWs) using a personalized, adaptable approach to lifestyle and life circumstance (PAL2) intervention. The investigators will leverage our MHU program, layering on top of existing services to streamline access for screening, recruitment and all ongoing follow-up throughout the study period. Our specific aims are:

AIM 1: To compare the effect of PAL2 intervention versus usual care (MHU engagement without PAL2) on systolic BP reduction and prevention of stage 2 HTN (systolic BP ≥ 140 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP \>90 mm Hg) among 500 Black adults with baseline untreated systolic BPs below stage 2 (ranging 110-139 mm Hg) and a diastolic BP \< 90 mm Hg.

Hypothesis (H) 1a: Systolic BP (primary outcome) will be reduced more in those randomized to PAL2 intervention versus usual care at 6 and 12 months.

H1b: Diastolic BP levels and the incidence of stage 2 HTN (systolic BP ≥ 140 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP \>90 mmm Hg) at 6 and 12 months (secondary outcomes) will be lower in participants randomized to the PAL2 intervention versus usual care.

AIM 2: To use the RE-AIM framework to assess the reach, adoption, effectiveness, sustainability and cost of LEAP-HTN at 12 months post-randomization.

H2a: The rates of adoption and sustainability of the PAL2 intervention will increase from baseline to 12 and up to 24 months in subjects with available data, respectively.

H2b: PAL2 intervention will be more cost-effective than usual care at 12 months and projected to be more cost-effective at 10 years.

Health Equity Impact: Targeted deployment of MHUs and PAL2 can mitigate several key adverse SDoH. LEAP-HTN contributes to the RESTORE Network by testing a sustainable and scalable approach to advance health equity and prevent HTN in Black adults participants. If successful, the use of MHU can be easily implemented in similar urban Black communities across the U.S.","NO","Hypertension|Blood Pressure|Cardiovascular Disease Other","BEHAVIORAL: PAL2","Systolic BP levels will be significantly lower (by ≥4 mm Hg) in participants randomized to the PAL2 (active) intervention versus usual care (control) over the first 12 months of the trial, Resting seated systolic BP will be measured in the dominant upper arm by validated automated BP monitors using a standardized protocol in accordance with the methods in the 2017 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) Hypertension guidelines.

OSA reduces quality of life and is associated with greater risk for cardiovascular disease. Although obesity is the single greatest reversible risk factor for OSA, patients with OSA and obesity rarely receive weight loss care to reverse OSA and other serious comorbidities. Efficacy trials reinforce that time and resource intensive lifestyle-based weight loss programs improve weight and physiologic measures of OSA severity (apnea hypopnea index, AHI). However, there are barriers to translating these findings into meaningful gains for population health. To meet these challenges, the investigators propose a pragmatic trial of proactively offering a remote video-based and self-directed lifestyle-based weight loss intervention with remote coaching to patients with OSA. The investigators primary aim is to test the effectiveness of a proactively delivered and pragmatic lifestyle intervention to improve co-primary endpoints of sleep-related quality of life and weight among patients with OSA and obesity. Secondarily, the investigators will compare additional outcomes between groups including cardiovascular risk scores, sleep symptoms, AHI, well-being, and global ratings of change. Finally, the investigators will also conduct an implementation process evaluation informed by the RE-AIM framework to identify barriers and facilitators to widespread implementation.

The investigators will identify patients with OSA and obesity nationwide (n=696) in VA using data from the VA's Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW), and the investigators will contact potentially eligible patients. After confirming eligibility and consent, the investigators will randomly assign subjects to receive the study's lifestyle intervention or usual care alone.

PPA specialist care is underdeveloped. There are very few specialists (neurologists, psychiatrists, neuropsychologists and speech therapists) and few hospitals- or community-based services dedicated to diagnosis and continuing care. Currently, healthcare systems struggle to provide adequate coverage of diagnostic services, and care is too often fragmented, uncoordinated, and unresponsive to the needs of people with PPA and their families. Recently attention has been gained by digital-health technologies, such immunoassay analyzer and high-field MRI, the most promising approaches to increase our understanding of neurodegeneration, and by new non-invasive brain stimulation techniques such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) that allow a personalized treatment approach. Our goal is to develop a new treatment approach in PPA in which the regional secondary care centers participating in this project should be the hub of a regional network. The MAINSTREAM (WP2- Efficacy of personalized training in the early stage of PPA) looks forward to introduce and evaluate therapeutic innovation such as tDCS coupled with language therapy in rehabilitation settings (WP2 Early Treatment).

This objective will be pursued by conducting a randomized controlled pilot study in order to evaluate the efficacy of a combined treatment of Active (anodal) tDCS and individualized language training compared to Placebo tDCS combined with individualized language training in a subgroup of mild PPA defined using the Progressive Aphasia Severity Scale (PASS) (Sapolsky D, Domoto-Reilly K, Dickerson BCJA.

Secondary objectives include determining if the intervention is associated with a reduction in emergency department (ED) visits or hospitalizations due to a fall, and examining five implementation outcomes: appropriateness, feasibility, fidelity, penetration, and equity.

This study is a pragmatic cluster-randomized trial to test the effectiveness of a primary care clinician value champion for de-implementing PIMs among patients 65 years of age and older with a diagnosis of dementia. Medicare Part D pharmacy claims data will be analyzed at the end of the 12-month intervention for the primary outcome, the medication possession rates (MPR) for three groups of potentially inappropriate medications: antipsychotic medications, benzodiazepines, and hypoglycemic medications (sulfonylureas and insulin). In a similar fashion, a hospital admission, or an emergency department visit for a fall will be assessed at the end of the intervention using Medicare claims data. Finally, the five implementation outcomes will be evaluated at the end of the intervention from notes entered by the value champions in project workbooks.

Primary care clinics within each of the two participating ACOs will be randomized to either the intervention or control arms of the study. Prior to random assignment, the investigators will stratify practices based on high versus low historic prescribing rates. A primary care clinician from each clinic selected for the trial in the intervention arm (n=30 across the two ACOs) will be recruited as a clinician value champion for each intervention clinic. The clinician value champion will participate in twice monthly value champion web-based training sessions for six months and then launch a 12-month initiative within the clinician value champions' clinics to reduce PIM prescribing among PLWD. Study outcomes will be assessed 12 months after the clinician value champions launch the initiative.

"599","NCT03254979","Optimizing the Primary Prevention of Type-2 Diabetes in Primary Health Care","COMPLETED","RATIONALE The translation into clinical practice of Primary Care (PHC) of effective and sustainable interventions to prevent of type-2 diabetes (T2D) remains an unresolved challenge. Leadership, active involvement of professionals, facilitation and adaptation to the local context and their determinants are known to be key components in the success of implementation strategies that seek to optimize clinical practice. However, one of the areas in which there is still no evidence is related to the effectiveness of different strategies to engage healthcare professionals in such innovation processes. Especially in real-world Primary Care clinical contexts characterized by work overload and limited time, with marked differentiation of professional status, both at the level of identity and competency.

OBJECTIVES To assess the effect of PHC providers engagement procedure in the creation and execution of a facilitated collaborative modelling process, in the adoption, reach, implementation and effectiveness of the recommended clinical practice for the prevention of type-2 Diabetes

METHODOLOGY

Randomized cluster hybrid trial in which 9 PHC centres from Osakidetza will be allocated to two different strategies to engage professionals and create an inter-professional collaborative practice directed by a local leader and an external facilitator, to optimize the integration of a T2D primary prevention program:

* A strategy focused on the sequential activation: started in nursing, which finally manages to involve the whole center
* A global strategy with the participation of all professionals from the beginning

All centres and PHC professionals will receive training on current guidelines and scientific evidence in primary prevention of T2D and effective interventions to promote healthy lifestyles. Headed by a local leader and an external facilitator, centres will conduct a collaborative structured process to model and adapt the intervention and its implementation to the specific context of professionals and centres, and the determinants of T2D prevention practice. One of the groups will perform this strategy globally, promoting the cooperation of all health professionals from the beginning. The other will perform it sequentially, centred first in nursing, who will lately seek the pragmatic cooperation of physicians and other professionals.

All patients without diabetes aged ≥30 years old who attend at least once in collaborating centres at high risk of developing T2DM (FINDRISC\> = 14 points and / or intermediate hyperglycaemia) will be eligible for program inclusion. The main outcome measures focus on observed changes in T2DM prevention clinical practice at centre level after 12 and 24 months, as a result of the implementation of one or another engagement strategy. Secondary outcomes will compare their clinical effectiveness in changing exposed eligible patients' main cardio-metabolic risk factors (Weight, BMI, Cholesterol, Glucose, Triglycerides) and lifestyles behaviours (physical activity and diet) after 12 months.","NO","Interprofessional Relations|Primary Health Care/Organization & Administration|Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/Prevention & Control|Primary Prevention/Methods|Risk Reduction Behavior|Randomized Controlled Trial|Life Style","BEHAVIORAL: Healthy lifestyle prescription","Implementation of the recommended clinical intervention by health care porfessionals, The proportion of non-diabetic patients at high risk of developing DM2 exposed to the recommended intervention actions : assessing habits, personalized advice, prescription of lifestyle change plans and follow-up, 12 months","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,432,"OTHER_GOV","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE (PARTICIPANT, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","2017-03-15","2019-12-30","2019-12-30","2017-08-21","","2020-07-09","Primary Care Research Unit of Bizkaia, OSAKIDETZA, Bilbao, Spain","behavioral"
"600","NCT02875379","Clinical Comparison of Different Humidification Strategies During Noninvasive Ventilation With Helmet","COMPLETED","Background. Non invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIV) is among first line treatments of acute respiratory failure. Several interfaces are available for non-invasive ventilation.Despite full face and oronasal masks are more frequently used, some evidence suggests that helmets may optimize patients' comfort and NIV tolerability.

During NIV, humidification strategies (heat and moisture exchangers HME or heated humidifiers HH) may significantly affect patient's comfort and work of breathing.

Despite physiological data suggested heated humidification as the best strategy during NIV with full face masks, no differences were found in a randomized controlled study assessing the effects of HME or HH on a pragmatic clinical outcome.

However, the higher dead space (i.e. 18 L/min) and rebreathing rate observed during helmet NIV make such results not applicable to this particular setting.

The investigators designed a randomized-crossover trial to assess the effect of four humidification strategies during helmet NIV on patients with acute respiratory failure, in terms of comfort, work of breathing and patient-ventilator interaction.

Methods. All awake, collaborative, hypoxemic patients requiring mechanical ventilation will be considered for the enrollment. Hypercapnic patients (i.e.PaCO2\>45 mmHg) will be excluded.

Each enrolled patient will undergo helmet NIV with all the following humidification strategies in a random order. Each period will last 60 minutes.

* Passive humidification, double tube circuit.
* Heated humification (MR 730, Fisher \& Paykel, Auckland, New Zealand), humidification chamber temperature 33°C.
* Heated humification (MR 730, Fisher \& Paykel, Auckland, New Zealand), humidification chamber temperature 37°C.
* Passive humidification with HME, Y-piece circuit.

Ventilatory settings (Draeger Evita xl or Evita infinity ventilators):

Pressure support ventilation; pressure support=20 cmH20; FiO2 titrated to obtain SpO2 between 92 and 98%; positive end-expiratory pressure=10 cmH2O; maximum inspiratory time 0.9 seconds; inspiratory flow trigger = 2 l/min; expiratory trigger: 30% of the maximum inspiratory flow; pressurization time=0,00 s.

Such settings will be kept unchanged during the whole study period. An oesophageal catheter will be placed and secured to measure oesophageal pressure (Pes) and gastric pressure (Pga) (Nutrivent, Italy): the reliability of the measured pressure will be confirmed with an airway occlusion test during NIV with oronasal mask. Work of breathing will be estimated with the pressure-time product (PTP) of the pleural pressure.

A pneumotachograph (KleisTek) will record flow, airway pressure, Pes and Pga on a dedicated laptop.

At the end of each cycle, the patient will be asked to rate his/her discomfort on a visual analog scale (VAS) modified for ICU patients. The level of dyspnea will be assessed with the Borg dyspnea scale.

The following parameters will be record at the end of each cycle:

Arterial pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, SpO2, pH, PCO2, PaO2, SaO2. Airway and esophageal pressure signals will be reviewed offline to detect patient-ventilator asynchronies (ineffective efforts, double cycling, premature cycling, delayed cycling) and asynchrony index (number of asynchrony events divided by the total respiratory rate computed as the sum of the number of ventilator cycles (triggered or not) and of wasted efforts) will be computed. The trigger delay will be also measured. The pressurization and depressurization velocity will be assessed with the PTP airway index 300 and 500 (inspiratory and expiratory), as suggested by Ferrone and coworkers. The work of breathing (WOB) for each breath will be estimated by PTPes.

An hygrometer (Dimar SRL, Italy) will measure and record on a dedicated laptop Helmet temperature, relative and absolute humidity.

Primary endpoints: patient's comfort, work of breathing and asynchrony index.

Lifestyle changes (e.g., physical activity, healthy diet, sufficient sleep, managing stress, smoking cessation) are often recommended to prevent or manage these conditions, but changing habits is difficult. Mental health can play a role in the ability to seek out and follow through on the changes necessary to achieve or maintain a healthy lifestyle, yet this aspect is rarely addressed, and access to mental health services is often limited. Furthermore, individuals are influenced by factors at the individual, interpersonal, community and policy levels (e.g., lack of socialization, unsafe neighborhoods). These factors can act as barriers and need to be addressed in order for individuals to make sustainable lifestyle changes.

A new year-long person-centered healthy lifestyles program is proposed to address the ""how to"" gap in making lifestyle changes through a combination of individual and group sessions.

"602","NCT04437238","Pilot Evaluation of ""KeepWell"" Using a Hybrid Effectiveness-Implementation Pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trial","COMPLETED","The burden of chronic disease is a global phenomenon, particularly amongst seniors. Aging is an expensive process. In Canada, 10% of seniors who have the most complex health needs account for 60% of the total annual health care spending in many provinces. Given these projections, we need to adapt our current models of care. In response, different chronic disease management tools have been created with a central aim to facilitate ongoing, proactive and preventive support for optimal chronic disease management. In particular, self-management tools have been acknowledged as an effective way to optimize disease management and are easily scalable and can reach a broader population of older people with chronic diseases. In fact, online self-management tools are particularly relevant for supporting seniors with complex care needs in their homes; and they are interested in using the Internet and social media. However, interventions and tools seldom consider all aspects of disease management, are not usually developed specifically for seniors or created for sustained use and are primarily focused on a single disease. As such, the projected health outcomes of seniors continue to remain poor, and the quality and efficiency of care remain sub-optimal. To respond to these challenges, we created an eHealth self-management application called ""KeepWell"" that supports seniors with complex care needs in their homes. It is a patient-centered, multi-chronic disease management tool that incorporates the care for two or more chronic conditions from among the top high-burden chronic diseases. KeepWell was built on a strong evidentiary base including several knowledge syntheses, a co-design process with our integrated knowledge translation team involving patients, researchers, clinicians and developers; and a usability and pilot evaluation.

A recent survey of practices regarding the management of IE in France showed that a switch from IV to oral antibiotics is feasible, when patients with left-sided Staphylococcus IE are stable after an initial course of IV antibiotic treatment, with or without valvular surgery.

These practices have not been associated with unfavourable outcome, while significantly reducing the duration and cost of hospitalization, the risk of nosocomial infection, and patients' discomfort.

There has been no randomized controlled trial (RCT) in the field of IE over the last 20 years; current guidelines are mostly based on expert advice, in vitro studies, animal experiments, or clinical studies performed before the 90's.

The RODEO 1 project is an unprecedented opportunity to bring back evidence-based medicine in the field of IE.

Most experts acknowledge that the pharmacological PK/PD characteristics of antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones and rifampicin allow a high level of efficacy in the treatment of IE when orally administrated after an IV period of induction.

It's needed to conduct RCTs that clearly demonstrate the clinical non-inferiority of this strategy for multisusceptible staphylococci with a benefit regarding costs.

The RODEO 1 project corresponds to one pragmatic trial assessing the impact of a switch strategy, making it a comparative effectiveness trial that should be able to feed the next revision of IE international guidelines and to change practices in IE management.","NO","Infective Endocarditis","DRUG: Levofloxacin|DRUG: Rifampicin|PROCEDURE: Conventional IV treatment of staphylococci IE following European guidelines 2015 including cloxacilline, oxacilline,gentamicine,vancomycine,rifampicine","Treatment failure, Failure is a composite outcome defined by death from all causes and/or symptomatic embolic events and/or unplanned valvular surgery and/or a microbiological relapse (with the primary pathogen)., up to 3 months after the end of antibiotic treatment","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT","PHASE3",324,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT","2016-02-29","2024-05","2024-09","2016-03-08","","2021-05-19","Service des Maladies infectieuses, Centre Hospitalier du Pays d'Aix, Aix en Provence, 13616, France|Service de court séjour gériatrique - EMG, Centre hospitalier d'Alès, Alès, 30103, France|Service de Pathologies infectieuses et tropicales, Hôpital Nord, CHU d'Amiens, Amiens, 80054, France|CHU ANGERS - Service des maladies infectieuses et tropicales, Angers, 49100, France|Service des Maladies infectieuses et Tropicales, Hôpital Jean Minjoz, CHU de Besançon, Besançon, 25030, France|Service de Maladies infectieuses et tropicales, Hôpital Avicenne, APHP, Bobigny, 93009, France|Service de Réanimation médicale, Hôpital St André, CHU de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, 33000, France|Service de Médecine interne, Hôpital Ambroise Paré, APHP, Boulogne Billancourt, 92104, France|Service de Maladies infectieuses, Hôpital de la Cavale Blanche, Brest, 29609, France|Service de Cardiologie, Hôpitall Louis Pradel, Hôpitaux Est, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Bron, 69677, France|Service Maladies Infectieuses et tropicales, Hôpital Côte de Nacre, CHU de Caen, Caen, 14033, France|Service de Maladies infectieuses et tropicales, médecine interne, CH de Chambéry, Chambéry, 73011, France|Service des maladies infectieuses et tropicales, Hôpital G.

Prevalence increases with age, and is more common in women than in men (1.6: 1). Although the natural evolution of cervical pain tends to improve, the rates of recurrence and chronicity are high. And therefore it becomes an anatomical region of interest in relation to the assessment of the effectiveness and / or effectiveness of the osteopathic therapeutic approach. Different studies prove the efficacy of various manual therapy techniques applied on the cervical and / or upper dorsal region, suggesting significant positive changes in cervical pain and mobility levels in patients with nonspecific cervical pain. It is necessary to bear in mind that the reality of the osteopathic approach to the patient is not limited to the use of a single technique, but that the treatment is formed from a set of them. The ultimate goal is to restore mobility and functionality to a specific region, especially taking into account the concepts of individuality and holism.

"611","NCT04094350","Effect of Community Active Case Finding Strategies for Detection of Tuberculosis in Cambodia","COMPLETED","Tuberculosis (TB) is a highly stigmatized disease, and approximately one-third of the Cambodian population living with TB are undetected. Therefore, it is vital to find these missing cases and promptly link them to care to reduce disease progression and interrupt further transmission. The integration of community-based, peer-driven intervention in TB active case finding (ACF) is relatively novel. In partnership with KHANA, the National Center for Tuberculosis and Leprosy Control (CENAT), and the Cambodia Anti-Tuberculosis Association (CATA), we will conduct a pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial comparing 1) the ACF with the seed-and-recruit model; 2) ACF targeting household and neighborhood contacts; 3) ACF targeting the older population using mobile screening units; and 4) passive case finding (PCF) approach. The primary outcome will be the case notification rate in the intervention and control districts during the study period. We will also determine additionality, comparing the yield in each arm with its respective historical baseline and the cumulative yield over the implementation period. The secondary outcomes include the number needed to screen to detect one TB case, cost-effectiveness (direct and indirect costs per TB case notified), and the treatment outcome of all people with TB in this study. The project will be carried out over two years in eight operational districts (province name in parenthesis) - Koh Soutin (Kampong Cham), Stong (Kampong Thom), Kanchreach (Prey Veng), Choeung Prey (Kampong Cham), Dambae (Thbong Khmum), Boribo (Kampong Chhnang), Ponhea Leu (Kandal), and Phnom Srouch (Kampong Speu) - in Cambodia. The selection was also based on the number of health centers to increase comparability and generalizability of study findings. This study will randomize currently underserved operational districts (without active intervention at least in the past six months from the implementation date) to receive the interventions (ACF) and PCF as the control. The results from this proposal will enable a nationwide scale-up of an effective intervention that is contextualized and complies with the principles set by the national TB program to find undiagnosed cases and control TB in Cambodia. Also, this project will complement existing ACF programs in Cambodia by expanding ACF to other operational districts that are currently not served by the Global Fund, its implementing partners, and other organizations. Findings from this trial could also potentially inform active case finding strategies in other countries with a high TB burden.","NO","Tuberculosis","OTHER: ACF with a seed-and-recruit model|OTHER: ACF targeting household and neighborhood contacts|OTHER: ACF targeting the older population using mobile screening units|OTHER: Passive case finding","Number of TB cases notified per 10000 population, Number of TB cases notified per 10000 population by each operational district included in this study per year, During the intervention period (1 year)|Additional number of TB cases, Additional number of TB cases reported compared to historical baseline (same period in the preceding 1 year), During the intervention period (1 year)|Number of TB cases diagnosed per 1000 population screened, Number of TB cases diagnosed per 1000 population screened during one year of the intervention period, During the intervention period (1 year)","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,2004,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: SCREENING","2019-12-16","2021-11-30","2022-01-31","2019-09-18","","2022-11-29","KHANA Center for Population Health Research, Phnom Penh, 2361, Cambodia|Cambodia Anti-Tuberculosis Association, Phnom Penh, 2589-384, Cambodia|National Center for Tuberculosis and Leprosy Control, Phnom Penh, 2589, Cambodia","other"
"612","NCT04833023","HALO Trial: Haloperidol vs Olanzapine in Hyperactive Delirium in Palliative Care Patients; A Multi-Centre, Randomised-Controlled Trial","RECRUITING","1. Background and Clinical Need:

   Delirium is common at the end of life and is challenging to control. There is a clinical need to study the benefits of commonly used drugs like Haloperidol and Olanzapine in the management of hyperactive delirium in advanced cancer or end-stage organ disease patients in a scientifically robust manner.
2. Aims/Hypotheses:

   The investigators aim to study the effectiveness of Haloperidol compared with Olanzapine in the management of hyperactive delirium in advanced cancer or end-stage organ disease patients receiving palliative care. The investigators hypothesise that Olanzapine is as effective as Haloperidol in the control of hyperactive delirium.
3. Methods:

   The investigators will conduct a pragmatic, multi-centre, (hospital, inpatient hospice, community hospital) open-label randomised-controlled trial comparing the use of Haloperidol versus Olanzapine in advanced cancer or end-stage organ disease patients with hyperactive delirium.

   The primary outcome is the change in Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS) scores among patients in each treatment group at 8 hours post-drug administration.

   The secondary outcome is the control of hyperactive delirium at 24, 48 and 72 hours using either Haloperidol or Olanzapine.

   The mean doses of Haloperidol and Olanzapine used as well as the volume of rescue Midazolam required as well as side-effects of the study medications, survival after enrolment into study will also be studied.
4. Significance to palliative care The results of this study will advance the knowledge of delirium management worldwide with regards to the efficacy of Haloperidol and Olanzapine in managing hyperactive delirium in patients with advanced cancer or end-stage organ disease.

Haloperidol is used traditionally in palliative care for managing delirium. However, as a conventional anti-psychotic, it does cause extra-pyramidal side-effects. Olanzapine, a newer atypical anti-psychotic with a more favourable side-effect profile is being used increasingly in the control of delirium.

"619","NCT03454555","Integrated Services for Pain: Interventions to Reduce Pain Effectively","ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING","What is the research about?

Chronic pain, or pain that lasts for months or years, is one of the most common health problems. Doctors often treat chronic pain with a type of medicine called opioids. Opioids can help ease pain in the short term. But long-term opioid use can lead to addiction or overdose.

This study compares two ways to help people living with chronic pain to improve their function while managing their pain. The study is looking at how each approach affects opioid use, pain levels, physical and emotional well-being, and satisfaction with pain care.

Who can this research help?

Doctors and patients can use findings from the study when considering ways to treat chronic pain.

What is the research team doing?

The research team enrolled 526 adults ages 18 to 85 who have used opioid medicines for at least 90 days to treat chronic pain. The patients are receiving care at three health systems in North Carolina and Tennessee. The team assigned patients by chance to one of two treatment groups. Patients in both groups get recommended opioid therapy. In the first group, doctors get training to talk with patients about the benefits, harms, and risks of different treatments and what matters most to the patient. Patients and doctors in this group make decisions about treatment together, based on each patient's values and preferences. Patients in the second group get eight weekly group sessions and one individual visit with a therapist. These sessions focus on enhancing and supporting patients' knowledge, beliefs, and skills in managing their pain.

The research team is looking at patients' electronic health records at the study's start and again at 6, 12, and 18 months. The team is comparing whether patients in the two groups reduce or stop using opioids. Patients also complete surveys at the study's start, at 6 months, and at 12 months to answer questions about

* Ability to do daily activities, such as running errands
* How pain interferes with their ability to do daily activities
* Pain level
* Anxiety and emotional distress
* Depression symptoms
* Ability to cope with pain
* Satisfaction with pain care

The research team is also comparing results among people with different backgrounds or health needs. The team is asking a small number of patients about their experiences with the study through interviews and focus groups.

An advisory committee is working with the team to design and conduct the study. The committee includes patients with chronic non-cancer pain; experts in pain management; and people from patient advocacy organizations, a state government agency, and a health insurer.","NO","Chronic Pain","BEHAVIORAL: Shared Decision Making|BEHAVIORAL: Motivational Interviewing and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Chronic Pain","Reduction of opioid use, Average daily opioid dose in milligrams of morphine equivalent.

Except for dexamethasone clinical trials offer conflicting evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of therapies.

Objective: Evaluate the effectiveness and safety of pharmacological therapies used to treat adult patients with COVID-19.

Methods: Pragmatic randomized controlled trial. Study population: Adults aged 18 years or over with a positive real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or with high suspicion of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV-2 (SARS CoV-2) and diagnosis of mild, severe or critical pneumonia, requiring hospital management at six hospitals in Colombia. Exclusion criteria: Pregnancy, known allergy to treatment, cirrhosis or hepatic abnormality (transaminases greater than 5 reference values), glomerular filtration rate lesser than 30 ml/min/1.73m\^2, history of lung fibrosis, advanced or metastatic cancer. A sample size was calculated from a sensitivity analysis with three scenarios:

scenario 1 a total of 1,163 patients, that is, 291 per treatment arm with alpha of Alpha = 0.05; power 0.8; Prop1 = 0.2 and Prop2 = 0.1 (expected difference of 10%) and 10% of possible losses,scenario 2. With the previous parameters and with a Prop1 = 0.15 and Prop2 = 0.05 for a total of 814 patients (204 per arm of treatment). scenario 3. With Alpha = 0.1, Prop1 = 0.15 and Prop2 = 0.05, the other previous parameters, for a total of 686 patients (172 per treatment). in scenario 1 the study will be carried out in two phases. The first phase will be conducted with 400 participants and aims to identify treatments with higher or minimum potential, discontinue treatments with higher toxicity, and have the opportunity of introducing new treatments with potential efficacy. The second phase will be conducted with 1,163 participants to evaluate the effectiveness of the selected treatments.

Four interventions have been defined: I1 Emtricitabine/ teneofovir , I2 Colchicine plus rosuvastatin, I3 Emtricitabine/ teneofovir plus Colchicine plus rosuvastatin and I4 standard treatment. Within each institution, participants will be randomly assigned to one of the treatment arms assigned to that institution. Concealment will be kept through software that maintain the assignment concealed until the random assignment is done . Treatment administration will be open. Variables: Sociodemographic and clinical at recruitment; (comorbidities, need for therapeutic support , grade of invasion at admission). Primary outcomes. Effectiveness: Mortality. Safety: Serious adverse events (AE) assessed by the NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) Guidance for Collection of Adverse Events Related to COVID-19 Infection. Secondary outcomes: Intensive care unit (ICU) admission, requirement of respiratory support, time to death, number of participants cured, any adverse event related to treatment.

Analysis: Descriptive for the presentation of summary measures of the basal conditions by type of variable. Bivariate. Description of the basal conditions (with organic failure at admission, without failure at admission), by type of treatment, by participating institution. Description of crude effectiveness and safety by means of the difference of accumulated incidences, each one with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) Intention to treat analyisis will be done. Adjusted analysis: The ratio and difference of cumulative incidences of mortality at 7 and 28 days and severe adverse events between treatments will be estimated, adjusting for confounding variables using logistic regression models with mixed effects considering each institution as a level or from equations. generalized estimation (GEE). On the other hand, as part of the pragmatic approach, the surface under cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) will be calculated based on Bayesian theory to define which drug has the highest probability of being the most useful in the management of infection.

The trial evaluates the effectiveness of a personalized eHealth intervention based on a hip-worn accelerometer, smartphone application and cloud service (www.exced.com) with or without face-to-face and telephone counselling contacts on physical activity (PA) compared to usual care in increasing daily PA and reducing sedentary behavior (SB) among type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients.The duration of the intervention period is 6 months, after which there is a 6 month follow-up for evaluating the maintenance of anticipated intervention effects. The primary goal of the intervention is that the T2D patients increase their daily number of steps by replacing SB with low intensity PA. The secondary goal is to increase short bouts of moderate-to-vigorous PA according to personal goals. It is expected that the eHealth intervention complemented by individual counselling is the most effective in reaching the goals, and the eHealth intervention is more effective than usual care.

Measurements are done at baseline, after the 6-month intervention, and after the 6-month follow-up. Participants' one-week PA and SB are measured with a hip-worn triaxial accelerometer and analyzed with validated algorithms. Cardiorespiratory fitness is assessed with a validated 6-minute walk test. Diabetes-related metabolic biomarkers (HbA1C, LDL-c, HDL-c, oxidized LDL and HDL lipids) and cardiovascular risk factors (blood pressure, BMI, waist circumference) are measured with standard laboratory methods. Quality of life is assessed by RAND-36 method. The interventions are evaluated with RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance) method. Besides effectiveness, RE-AIM methods evaluates the target group reach and adherence; provider adoption; intervention fidelity; maintenance of the changes in PA and SB behavior, biomarkers and CVD risk factors; intervention transferability to clinical practice; adverse events; and patient and provider satisfaction.

Unexpectedly, the COVID-19 pandemic in spring 2020 led to substantial restrictions in outdoors mobility of T2D patients and their access access to health care in Finland, facts that frustrated the planned implementation of the original intervention, related measurements and their scheduling. This means that not all planned measurements could be done at all or at the scheduled time point. Irrespective of the time of recruitment, all follow-up measurements are done from June to September 2020. Notwithstanding the COVID-19 pandemic annulled the original intervention, the collected data yet provides unique insights into measured physical activity, fitness and metabolic biomarkers of T2D patients before and during the COVID-19 pandemic and consequent restrictions.In addition, the data allows to evaluate the implementation of eHealth approach and face-to-face and telephone PA counselling contacts within the primary health care setting.","NO","Type2 Diabetes","BEHAVIORAL: eHealth +counselling contacts|BEHAVIORAL: eHealth|BEHAVIORAL: Usual care","Change in total mean daily step count, Step count during one week is measured with a hip-worn accelerometer at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months, At 6 and 12 months compared to baseline (0 months).

An initial pragmatic randomized control trial found that IMGV led to significant improvement in mental health related quality of life and lower use of high-cost care. However, there has been little research investigating the implementation of IMGV, and none in Federally-Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), where the program was initially designed to be implemented.

The study implements two approaches with high level of evidence, namely the use of comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) approach in treatment decision making and the use of CDK 4/6-inhibitors as the initial treatment of choice, to investigate whether a common clinical practice (starting dose reduction of CDK 4/6-inhibitors in older patients) with evidence of low certainty can be standardized using a more individualized-based approach.

On the basis of baseline CGA assessment, patients will either receive full dose of CDK 4/6-inhibitors plus endocrine therapy (if patients are fit according to CGA) or be randomized to full dose vs. reduced initial dose of CDK 4/6-inhibitors (if vulnerable or frail according to CGA). The study hypothesis is that adjusting the dose according to vulnerability will allow patients to tolerate treatment better without jeopardizing the treatment efficacy.

"646","NCT02779712","Remote Ischaemic Conditioning After Stroke Trial (ReCAST-2)","COMPLETED","Stroke has an enormous impact on both individual and society. Novel treatments are required to relieve this burden and remote ischaemic conditioning (RIC) is one such approach. RIC refers to applying non-lethal ischaemia to an area distant from an organ you are trying to protect (e.g. the brain). Pre-clinical animal stroke studies have shown RIC to be neuroprotective and help restore functional outcome when compared to control. These outcomes are achieved simply by transiently occluding the blood supply to a limb (e.g. the arm) very soon after the stroke occurs. The mechanisms of protection are unclear but may be due enhancing the body's ability to protect itself from further injury by favorably altering cerebral blood flow or reducing the detrimental effects of oxygen free radicals. Ischaemic conditioning (IC) is an intervention already applied during cardiac surgery to protect the heart from damage and it may be effective after an acute myocardial infarction. The investigators therefore plan to conduct a pilot randomised controlled trial assessing the feasibility of applying RIC (4 cycles of blood pressure cuff inflation for 5 minutes) in patients within 6 hours of ischaemic stroke. The primary outcome is feasibility of RIC. Secondary outcomes include tolerability, safety and clinical efficacy. The results will inform the design of future trials of a potential intervention is that is pragmatic, non-invasive and simple to administer.","NO","Stroke","PROCEDURE: Remote ischaemic conditioning|PROCEDURE: Sham","Trial feasibility, Recruitment feasibility (recruitment rate), 90 days","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT","PHASE2",60,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE (PARTICIPANT, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT","2016-08-01","2018-07-23","2018-07-23","2016-05-20","","2018-10-11","Derby Teaching Hospitals Foundation Trust, Derby, Derbyshire, DE22 3DT, United Kingdom|Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, NG5 1PB, United Kingdom","procedure"
"647","NCT04094012","Risk of SDRs Under 3HP and 1HP Regimen for LTBI","COMPLETED","Successful implement of preventive therapy for subjects with latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is the critical step for elimination of tuberculosis (TB). The major obstacle of traditional preventive therapy is the unacceptable long treatment duration, taking isoniazid 5mg/kg daily for a total of 9 months (9H), thus seriously compromising its acceptability. With the introduction of 12-doses weekly high-dose (15 mg/kg) rifapentine plus isoniazid (3HP regimen), the completion rate of 3HP has be shown to be much higher than 9H. However, 4.9% to 9.1% of LTBI cases who received 3HP failed to complete treatment because of side effects. Systemic drug reactions (SDRs), even hypotension and shock, under 3HP treatment are higher than 9H treatment.

A recent study in HIV patients demonstrated that a new short-term regimen, consisting of isoniazid 5mg/kg plus rifapentine 10mg/kg daily for one month (1HP), has a similar risk of adverse reactions as 3HP. Clinical study with head-to-head comparison between 3HP and 1HP, however, remains lacking.

The prospective multicenter study is conducted to investigate whether risk of SDRs under 1HP is lower than that under 3HP.

"648","NCT03617146","Coaching and Education for Diabetes Distress","TERMINATED","Diabetes distress (DD) is a negative emotional reaction to a diagnosis of diabetes and concerns about the burden of managing diabetes, the risk of complications, and inadequate support system. DD is common among people with diabetes and is strongly associated with poor diabetes self-care and poor diabetes control. Reducing DD should thus be an important component of diabetes management. In line with the growing evidence, the American Diabetes Association now recommends that providers ""routinely monitor people with diabetes for diabetes distress, particularly when treatment targets are not met"". Despite increased recognition of the need to manage DD, interventions that are both feasible and effective for reducing DD in routine care settings are not yet known. A pilot study showed that health coaching (HC) has some efficacy in addressing DD but no adequately powered study has implemented a pragmatic research design capable of assessing the real-world effectiveness of HC in reducing DD.

This study seeks to assess whether HC effectively reduces DD among primary care patients with diabetes, and whether HC is more effective than an educational program targeting DD. The investigators hypothesize that over a 6-month period, patients with poorly controlled diabetes and DD who enroll in and complete at least five HC sessions will achieve higher and clinically significant reductions in DD and HbA1c, and greater compliance with diabetes self-care recommendations than those who receive only an educational program targeting DD as part of usual diabetes care.

The two-arm randomized controlled trial for patients with poorly-controlled diabetes is taking place at an academic family medicine practice in Houston, Texas. Both arms will receive usual care, which includes education about DD. In addition, the intervention arm will receive eight HC sessions over a five-month period. The primary outcome measure is reduction in DD over a six month period. Additional outcome measures include changes in glycemic control (HbA1C) and self-care practices (medication adherence, dietary, and physical activity behaviors). The study will also measure satisfaction and willingness-to-pay for HC to determine the extent to which HC, if effective for reducing DD, can be operationalized in similar healthcare settings.","NO","Diabetes Distress","BEHAVIORAL: Health coaching|OTHER: Diabetes Distress-specific Education","Diabetes distress score, Change in diabetes distress score as measured by the diabetes distress scale (DDS).

While increasing numbers of patients are seeking acupuncture treatment for depression in recent years, there is limited evidence of the effectiveness of acupuncture for in-hospital patients with severe depressive conditions and comorbid cognitive dysfunction, who need intensive antidepression care.

In this study, we propose a randomized clinical trial to test the clinical efficacy of acupuncture treatment for in-hospital patients who are suffering from major depressive disorder. A total of 84 patients will be 1:1 randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups in a single-blind randomized controlled trial. The specific intervention arm involved daily augmentation TCM-style acupuncture with manual stimulation for total 10 sessions; the control arm is consisted of patients with treatment as usual (TAU), i. e. waitlist condition who will receive standard antidepressant medication with or without psychotherapies. Patients in TAU arm will be offered one free course (total 10 sessions) of acupuncture treatment in TCM outpatient clinic after they have been discharged from the ward. All patients' depressive symptoms, cognitive function, quality of life and functioning will be assessed and compared at pre-treatment (baseline), immediately after in-hospital acupuncture treatment, one-month post-treatment and 3-month post-treatment. In addition, we will analyze the association of sociodemographic and clinical characteristics with the treatment effect of acupuncture.

"650","NCT05156346","Pragmatic RCT to Assess the Effectiveness of an Online Self-help Programme for Older Adults After Spousal Bereavement","COMPLETED","Introduction: The death of a partner is a frequent and very stressful critical life event in later life. Grief and psychological distress after the loss of a partner are normative reactions. However, 10% of individuals are less able to cope with bereavement and show symptoms of disturbed or prolonged grief, or adaptation problems. Focus groups have concluded that Portuguese older adults who lost their partner avoid and downplay the grief process, not seeking help when needed. LEAVES is an interactive self-help online programme founded in the task model of mourning and the dual-process model of coping with bereavement that supports older adults who have lost their partner in dealing with and preventing prolonged grief. As part of an international consortium with two more trial centres, LEAVES-PT will carry out a 10-week pragmatic randomised two-armed parallel-group controlled trial to determine the effectiveness of LEAVES vs. usual care in reducing grief in community-dwelling Portuguese adults over 55 years who have lost a partner. Besides the clinical evaluation, a cost-effectiveness analysis will be carried out.

Methods: Adults over 55 years, who have lost a partner and are registered with a primary care service in Lower Alentejo, Portugal will be invited to participate and, after screening for eligibility, a minimum of 100 will be randomised to one of two arms: usual care + LEAVES online service or usual care (1:1). The intervention will last for 10 weeks and follow-up will last for a further 10 weeks (20 weeks). Grief is the primary endpoint and it is measured by the Texas Revised Inventory of Grief.

Integrating high-quality, equitable, and cost-effective care across the continuum of supportive, palliative, and end-of-life care for both patients and family caregivers is highly relevant from a healthcare, prevention, and economic perspective.

EU NAVIGATE is an interdisciplinary, cross-country, and intersectoral project funded by the European Union. The overall aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a patient and family navigation intervention (NavCare-EU) for older people with cancer and declining health and their family caregivers in different healthcare systems in Europe. Nav-Care EU is a person- and family-centered non-pharmacological intervention in which navigators collaborate with patients and families to improve quality of life and improve levels of social support, foster empowerment, and facilitate timely and equitable access to health and social care services and resources as needed, throughout the supportive and palliative care continuum. NavCare-EU is based on the existing and successfully tested Nav-CARE(c) intervention from Canada.

Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness will be evaluated through an international 6-country multisite pragmatic fast-track randomised controlled trial (RCT) with an embedded mixed methods process evaluation to compare the NavCare-EU intervention in addition to standard care with the provision of standard care alone. The RCT and process evaluation will be conducted in Belgium (Flanders), Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, and Portugal. Participants are people with cancer and declining health, who are aged 70 years and older, as well as their close family caregivers.

Specific objectives are:

1. To compare the NavCare-EU intervention to care as usual, in terms of its:

1. Effectiveness on (1) global health status/quality of life, and the levels of social support (two co-primary outcomes); and on feelings of loneliness of older persons with cancer across the continuum of supportive, palliative, and end-of-life care; (2) family caregiver burden
2. cost-effectiveness
3. effects on different subgroups defined by characteristics known to affect health equity and equitable access, i.e., gender, age, socioeconomic status, extent of social support and living situation, and geographical location (rural vs. urban)
4. effectiveness and cost-effectiveness in different health care systems and care regimes in Europe

2. To evaluate the implementation processes of the NavCare-EU intervention and the feasibility of its integration in different health care systems and care regimens in Europe, the contextual barriers and facilitators for effective and sustainable implementation, and the mechanisms involved in reaching the outcomes in each country, as perceived by patients, family caregivers, and other care providers","NO","Cancer (Active Cancer, Meaning Not Being Cancer Free), of Any Stage and Involving Any Treatment/Care Regimen; i.e. Curative, Life-extending, or Palliative","BEHAVIORAL: NavCare-EU","Global health status/quality of life of the older person with cancer, Global health status/quality of life of the older person with cancer, measured with 2-item subscale from the EORTC-QLQ-C30 (revised) measuring health-related quality of life., Change from baseline at 24 weeks.|Levels of social support of the older person with cancer, Levels of social support of the older person with cancer measured with the Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey (MOS), Change from baseline at 24 weeks.","ALL","OLDER_ADULT",NA,489,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: SUPPORTIVE_CARE","2023-11-15","2025-05","2026-05","2023-10-31","","2023-10-31","","behavioral"

The three different strategies are: 1) text messages, 2) interactive chatbot messages, and 3) chatbot messages with proactive pharmacist support. To measure cardiovascular risk factors, the investigators are using the American Heart Association's Life's Essential 8 (LE8) factors-blood glucose, cholesterol, blood pressure, physical activity, body mass index, diet, and smoking.

This study focuses on improving cardiovascular risk factors for individuals facing health disparities, such as ethnic minorities, limited English proficiency, and low-income groups. These groups are more likely to be seriously affected by cardiovascular diseases. Self-management, or an individual's roles in managing their own chronic disease, includes lifestyle changes, medication adherence. Improving patients' self-management has been shown to improve health behaviors, better disease control and improved patient outcomes.

The main question this study aims to answer is if one of the strategies (texting, chatbot, or chatbot with pharmacist support) may improve patient self-management and patient outcomes.

The investigators will enroll up to 2,100 patients from three health systems that serve large populations experiencing health disparities: Denver Health, Salud Family Health Centers, and STRIDE Community Health Center.

"672","NCT03951350","Lifestyle Modification Program in the Prevention and Treatment of Depression","COMPLETED","Introduction:

Major depression is a highly prevalent pathology that is currently the second most common cause of disease-induced disability in our society. The onset and continuation of depression may be related to a wide variety of biological and psychosocial factors, many of which are linked to different lifestyle aspects. Therefore, health systems must design and implement health promotion and lifestyle modification programs, taking into account personal factors and facilitators. The main objective of this work is to analyze the utility and cost-effectiveness of an adjunctive treatment program for subclinical, mild or moderate depression in Primary Care patients, based on healthier lifestyle recommendations. Secondary objectives include the analysis of the effectiveness of the intervention in comorbid chronic pathology and the measurement of the influence of personal factors on lifestyle modification.

Methods and analysis:

A randomized, multicenter pragmatic clinical trial with 3 parallel groups consisting of primary healthcare patients suffering from subclinical, mild or moderate depression. The following interventions will be used: 1. Usual antidepressant treatment with psychological advice and/or psychotropic drugs prescribed by the General Practitioner (treatment-as-usual, TAU). 2. TAU + Lifestyle Modification Program (LMP). A program to be imparted in 6 weekly 90-minute group sessions, intended to improve the following aspects: behavioral activation + daily physical activity + adherence to the Mediterranean diet pattern + sleep hygiene + careful exposure to sunlight. 3. TAU + LMP + ICTs: healthy lifestyle recommendations (TAU+LMP intervention) + monitoring using ICTs (a wearable smartwatch). The primary outcome will be the depressive symptomatology and the secondary outcomes will be the quality of life, the use of health and social resources, personal variables related to program adherence (patient activation in their own health, self-efficacy, sense of coherence, health literacy and procrastination) and chronic comorbid pathology. Data will be collected before and after the intervention, with 6- and 12-month follow-ups.","NO","Depression","BEHAVIORAL: Lifestyle Modification Program (LMP)|BEHAVIORAL: Lifestyle Modification Program (LMP) + Information Communication Technologies (ICTs)","Beck II Self-Applied Depression Inventory (BDI-II), The primary outcome will be measured using the BDI-II (Beck et al., 1996).

It was translated and validated into Spanish with a reliability of .89 (Sanz et al., 2005). The standardized cutoffs are: 0-13: minimal depression; 14-19: mild depression; 20-28: moderate depression; 29-63: severe depression., Change from baseline, immediately after the intervention and at six and 12-month follow-up.","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,159,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE (INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT","2020-04-01","2020-07-01","2021-02-01","2019-05-15","","2021-02-11","Alejandra Aguilar-Latorre, Zaragoza, 50009, Spain","behavioral"
"673","NCT05927623","Multifaceted Intervention Using Telehealth to Reduce the Risk of Falls and Fractures in Older Men","RECRUITING","Men sustain over one-third of osteoporosis-related fractures worldwide. The burden of osteoporotic fractures in older men is substantial, and men suffer significantly worse fracture-related outcomes than women. Following a fracture, men sustain greater rates of subsequent fractures, loss of autonomy, and mortality than women and the imminent risk of re-fracture is several times higher in men than in women. Functional mobility, known to predict falls and fractures, is also notably worse in men following a fracture. In the fiscal year 2007-08, the overall annual costs of osteoporosis in Canadian men was evaluated to be $910 million.

Osteoporosis is primarily considered a disease of older women, and men are remarkably under-evaluated and under-treated for it. Recognition of sex and gender influences on skeletal health in men has been very slow; akin to the gap in cardiovascular diseases, where women are far less likely to receive guideline-recommended investigations and treatment.

Over 85% of Canadian men who suffer from fragility fractures do not receive osteoporosis screening and/or treatment strategies. The existence of this care gap in men underscores our current struggle to overcome important barriers including: 1) men's lack of awareness of the critical impact of osteoporosis and fractures on several aspects of their lives, and of the benefits of treatment; and 2) the absence of comprehensive and accessible treatments tailored to men.

Informed by the Knowledge-to-Action framework, we aim to address these barriers by adapting interventions with proven efficacy to engage men at high fracture risk in health behaviour change.

The current protocol is for a pilot RCT to determine the feasibility of recruitment and retention, adherence to, and acceptability of the virtually-delivered fracture prevention intervention only.

Our long-term goal is to conduct a large pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT) to address the research question: In older adults at high risk for fractures who self-identify as men, does anti-osteoporosis pharmacotherapy in conjunction with a virtually-delivered intervention that includes a gender-tailored strength training and balance based exercise program and nutritional counselling, improve functional mobility compared to anti-osteoporosis pharmacotherapy in conjunction with an attention control intervention.","NO","Osteoporosis|Osteoporotic Fractures|Osteoporosis, Age-Related|Muscle Loss|Men|Aging","BEHAVIORAL: Multifaceted Virtual Fracture Prevention Program|BEHAVIORAL: Attention Control","Study recruitment rates (feasibility objective), The study will be considered feasible if the investigators can recruit 12 participants per site within one year, 12 months|Study retention rates (feasibility objective), The study will be considered feasible if ≥ 75 % of the sample completes the 12-month assessment, 12 months|Adherence to the exercise and nutrition interventions (feasibility objective), The exercise intervention will be considered feasible if participants complete ≥ 65% of the prescribed number of exercise sessions at the 12-month follow-up.

Nine pairs of diverse primary care practices will participate, four pairs of federally qualified health centers clinics and 5 pairs of practice based research network practices. Practice pairs are similar in size, patient and staff mix, culture, and level of EHR integration. Within pairs, practices will be randomized to early or delayed intervention (4 months later). The intervention consists of implementing the MOHR assessment and patient counseling into clinical care for all patients presenting for wellness or chronic care during a 6 month study period. Prior to implementation, practices will receive brief training about health behavior counseling, goal setting, and action planning. Practices will also be provided materials to support evidence-based counseling and referrals to local community resources. MOHR assessment implementation details will be determined by each practice pair but will generally include (1) asking patients to complete the MOHR assessment on the web prior to encounters (available at www.MyOwnHealthReport.org it addresses10 distinct health behaviors and psychosocial issues including physical activity, diet, alcohol consumption, tobacco use, drug use, sleep, stress, depression and anxiety), (2) provision, via the tool, immediate patient feedback that includes identification of unhealthy issues, assessment of readiness to change, prioritization of issues to change, and preparation for goal-setting and action planning, (3) feedback to the primary care team on the patient status and priorities for change, (4) provision of counseling, goal setting, and referrals to local resources by clinicians during the subsequent office visit, and (5) follow-up with the clinicians and local resources as agreed upon by the patient and clinician. Data sources will include patient responses to the MOHR assessment, practice appointment records, and a patient experience survey mailed to the first 300 patients offered the MOHR assessment two weeks after their office visit. Primary outcomes will include the Reach and Effectiveness of the intervention. Reach will be assessed in early and delayed intervention sites when they field the MOHR assessment. Effectiveness will compare early and delayed intervention sites during the early intervention phase, allowing the delayed intervention sites to serve as controls. Reach outcomes will include the percent of eligible patients receiving and completing the MOHR assessment. Effectiveness outcomes will include the percent of patients reporting that they were asked about health topics, set a change goal, received assistance for making a change, were referred for local counseling and support, and/or made any changes. Additional outcomes will include maintenance of the MOHR assessment implementation beyond 4 months, changes in patient reported health behavior and psychosocial measures by repeated administration of the MOHR assessment 4 months after initial completion, qualitative assessments on implementation factors and context that influence outcomes, and cost, in terms of time and resources required for practices to implement the MOHR assessment.","NO","Health Behaviors|Obesity|Substance Abuse|Anxiety|Depression","OTHER: Implementation of the MOHR assessment in primary care workflow","Reach, The percent of eligible patients (e.g. those presenting for wellness or chronic care) who are offered the MOHR assessment and who complete the MOHR assessment, Entire 6 month early or delayed implementation phase|Effectiveness - Ask, The percent of patients reporting that they were asked about health behavior and psychosocial topics in the early implementation (intervention) versus the delayed implementation (control) practices, 6 month early implementation phase|Effectiveness - Goal Setting, The percent of patients reporting that they set a goal about health behavior and psychosocial topics in the early implementation (intervention) versus the delayed implementation (control) practices, 6 month early implementation phase|Effectiveness - Assistance, The percent of patients reporting that received assistance for health behavior and psychosocial topic in the early implementation (intervention) versus the delayed implementation (control) practices, 6 month early implementation phase|Effectiveness - Referred, The percent of patients reporting that they were referred for health behavior and psychosocial counseling to a local program in the early implementation (intervention) versus the delayed implementation (control) practices, 6 month early implementation phase","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,3591,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: PREVENTION","2013-03","2014-02","2014-02","2013-04-08","","2015-05-13","UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, Los Angeles, California, 90095-1772, United States|University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, 27599, United States|OCHIN, Portland, Oregon, 92201-5195, United States|Department of Health Promotion and Community Health Sciences, Texas A&M Health Sciences Center School of Rural Public Health, College Station, Texas, 77483, United States|University of Texas School of Public Health, Houston, Texas, 77030, United States|Vermont College of Medicine, Burlington, Vermont, 05405, United States|Virginia Ambulatory Care Outcomes Research Network, Richmond, Virginia, 23298, United States|Carilion Health System, Roanoke, Virginia, 24033, United States","other"

To address persistent morbidity and mortality for sepsis survivors, Atrium Health developed the Sepsis Treatment and Recovery (STAR) program which uses a nurse navigator to deliver a bundle of best-practice care elements for the delivery of longitudinal post-sepsis care for up to 90 days. These care elements are directed towards the specific challenges and sequelae following a sepsis hospitalization and include: 1) identification and treatment of new physical, mental, and cognitive deficits; 2) review and adjustment of medications; 3) surveillance of treatable conditions that commonly lead to poor outcomes including chronic conditions that may de-stabilize during sepsis and recovery; and 4) focus on palliative care when appropriate. ENCOMPASS (Engagement and Collaborative Management to Proactively Advance Sepsis Survivorship) is an effectiveness-implementation hybrid type I trial, with the evaluation designed as a two-arm, pragmatic, stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial conducted at eight regional hospitals in which each participating hospital begins in a usual care control phase and transitions to the STAR program intervention in a randomly assigned sequence.

"689","NCT04378946","Error Augmentation Motor Learning Training Approach in Stroke Patients","UNKNOWN","Deficits in upper limb (UL) functional recovery persist in a large proportion of stroke survivors. Understanding how to obtain the best possible UL recovery is a major scientific, clinical and patient priority. We propose that UL motor recovery may be improved by training that focuses on remediating an individual's specific motor impairment. Our approach is based on evidence that deficits in the control of muscle activation thresholds (spatial thresholds) of the elbow in stroke underlie impairments such as disordered movement and spasticity. Our novel training program focuses on improving the individual's active elbow control range using error augmentation (EA) feedback. Since training intensity and lesion load are key factors in motor recovery that lack guidelines, we will also investigate effects of exercise dose and corticospinal tract (CST) injury on UL recovery.

In this multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial (RCT), patients with stroke will participate in an individualized intensive technology-assisted reaching training program, based on error augmentation (EA), in order to improve voluntary elbow function. They will practice robot-assisted reaching in a virtual reality (VR) game setting. We will identify if intensive training with feedback aimed at expanding the range of spatial threshold (ST) control at the elbow (experimental group) is better than intensive training with general feedback about task success (control group). We will also determine the patient-specific optimal therapy dose by comparing kinematic and clinical outcomes after 3, 6 and 9 weeks of intensive training, and again at 4 weeks after training to determine carry-over effects. We will quantify the severity of the participant's motor deficit, as the amount of cortico spinal tract (CST) injury due to the stroke (%CST injury) and relate training gains to their %CST injury. Results of this pragmatic trial will provide essential information for optimizing individualized post-stroke training programs and help determine optimal patient-specific training dosing to improve motor recovery in people with different levels of stroke severity.

This type of research involving personalized, impairment-based feedback and dose-effective training has the potential to significantly improve rehabilitation for a greater number of post-stroke individuals and improve the health and quality of life of Canadians.","NO","Stroke Rehabilitation|Cerebrovascular Stroke|Muscle Spasticity|Upper Extremity Paresis","BEHAVIORAL: Intensive physical rehabilitation type training|DEVICE: Robotic system for supporting and monitoring arm motion|DEVICE: Actigraph Activity Monitor|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Montreal Spasticity Measure (MSM)","Change in elbow spatial threshold (ST) angle and the range of active elbow extension, The elbow ST angle will be identified with the Montreal Spasticity Measure (MSM).

Although the treatment of choice has historically consisted of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), this is not always feasible or practical, and carries a risk of side-effects that may be unacceptable to certain patients.

In this pragmatic, multi-site, placebo-controlled and double-blinded clinical trial, participants with ultra treatment-resistant MDD will be randomized to receive either active or sham transcranial direct current stimulation in addition to their usual treatment. Ultra treatment-resistant depression will be operationally defined as MDD that has failed to respond to at least five previous trials of antidepressants at sufficient doses, or ECT, or ketamine. Patients will receive a total of 30 active or sham treatment sessions (5 per week), for 30 minutes per session. In both groups, the anode will be placed over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (position F3), and the cathode over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (position F4). Patients in the sham group will receive electrical stimulation at 2 mA for less than 30 seconds, whereas patients in the active group will receive that level of stimulation for the entire duration of treatment.

"699","NCT03488212","Online Obesity Treatment in Primary Care (Rhode Island, USA)","UNKNOWN","Behavioral obesity treatment produces clinically significant weight loss; for the greatest impact, it should be made available in the primary care setting where it can reach the many patients with overweight/obesity. The investigators developed a 3-month automated online behavioral weight loss program, Rx Weight Loss (RxWL), and showed that it produces clinically significant weight losses among primary care patients. The investigators' early efforts at pragmatic implementation of RxWL have been promising, and have shed light on challenges associated with implementation, and the need to study longer-term effectiveness. The investigators will therefore conduct a pragmatic study to improve the implementation and effectiveness of this behavioral obesity intervention delivered in routine and representative healthcare settings. The investigators are partnering with the Rhode Island Primary Care Physicians Corporation (RIPCPC), a large primary care network of 58 practices with 100 physicians and 16 nurse care managers. Using the framework for Effectiveness-Implementation Hybrid Designs, the investigators will simultaneously target effectiveness and implementation to maximize the public health impact of the research. Half of the 16 nurse care managers, and the practices they serve, will be randomized to either Basic Implementation (alerts generated using the electronic medical record \[EMR\] to direct eligible patients to RxWL), or to the Enhanced Implementation (alerts, clinician skills training to motivate and support weight loss, clinician dashboard with reports on patient progress and tools to facilitate patient engagement and behavior change). The investigators will test the hypothesis that the Enhanced Implementation will increase the proportion of patients directed to, enrolling, and completing the weight loss program. Because maintenance of weight loss is a critical problem, this project will also involve randomization of 600 patients with overweight/obesity and type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and/or hypercholesterolemia to the 3 month RxWL intervention followed by one of three maintenance conditions: (a) Control- 9 monthly online education sessions; (b) Monthly Lessons and Feedback- 9 monthly online video lessons teaching self-regulation with automated feedback on the self-monitoring record; (c) Refresher Campaigns- 9 monthly on-line video sessions, teaching self-regulation and providing two 4-week courses with novel strategies and behavioral challenges to improve long-term outcomes. The investigators will test the hypothesis that 12-month weight losses are better with Refresher Campaigns than Monthly Lessons and Feedback, and both are better than Control. Secondary outcomes include changes in weight, CVD risk factors, and medication use over a full 24 months. The project is significant and innovative because: it uses an empirically validated approach to obesity treatment that is integrated into the primary care setting, leveraging existing staff and EMR capabilities; it has a dual focus on improving effectiveness and implementation; it has a pragmatic design in partnership with a large primary care network that treats a diverse patient population; and it has potential to it provides a scalable, sustainable approach that can serve as a model for broader dissemination of obesity treatment intervention.","NO","Overweight and Obesity","BEHAVIORAL: Training to Identify Eligible Patients and Direct them to Online Obesity Treatment Program|BEHAVIORAL: Training to Motivate and Support Patients' Weight Loss|BEHAVIORAL: Online Behavioral Weight Loss Intervention|BEHAVIORAL: Control Intervention for Weight Loss Maintenance and Weight Gain Prevention|BEHAVIORAL: Monthly Lessons and Feedback Intervention for Weight Loss Maintenance and Weight Gain Prevention|BEHAVIORAL: Refresher Courses for Weight Loss Maintenance and Weight Gain Prevention","Change in Weight, 12 months after study enrollment","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,600,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT","2018-05-31","2021-04-30","2021-04-30","2018-04-04","","2020-02-20","Weight Control and Diabetes Resarch Center, Providence, Rhode Island, 02903, United States","behavioral"
"700","NCT02999412","Medication Reviews Bridging Healthcare: a Cluster-randomised Crossover Trial","COMPLETED","Background: Mismanaged prescribing and use of medication among elderly puts major pressure on current healthcare systems. Performing a medication review, a structured critical examination of a patient's medications, during hospital stay with active follow-up into primary care could optimise treatment benefit and minimise harm. However, a lack of high quality evidence inhibits widespread implementation. This manuscript describes the rationale and design of a pragmatic cluster-randomised, crossover trial to fulfil this need for evidence.

Aim: To study the effects of hospital-initiated comprehensive medication reviews, including active follow-up, on elderly patients' healthcare utilisation compared to 1) usual care and 2) solely hospital based reviews.

Design: Multicentre, three-treatment, replicated, cluster-randomised, crossover trial.

Setting: 8 wards with a multidisciplinary team within 4 hospitals in 3 Swedish counties.

Participants: Patients aged 65 years or older, admitted to one of the study wards. Exclusion criteria: Palliative stage; residing in other than the hospital's county; medication review within the last 30 days; one-day admission.

Interventions: 1, comprehensive medication review during hospital stay; 2, same as 1 with the addition of active follow-up into primary care; 3, usual care.

Primary outcome measure: Incidence of unplanned hospital visits during a 12-month follow-up period.

Data collection and analyses: Extraction and collection from the counties' medical record system into a GCP compliant electronic data capture system. Intention-to-treat-analyses using log-linear Poisson generalized linear mixed models and frailty models.

Relevance: This study has a high potential to show a reduction in elderly patients' morbidity, contributing to more sustainable healthcare in the long run.","NO","Medication Review","PROCEDURE: Comprehensive medication review|PROCEDURE: Comprehensive medication review with active follow-up|PROCEDURE: Usual Care","Incidence of unplanned hospital visits, extracted from the patients' electronic medical record, Admissions plus visits to the emergency department, 12 months","ALL","OLDER_ADULT",NA,2637,"OTHER_GOV","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: CROSSOVER|Masking: SINGLE (OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","2017-02-06","2019-12-11","2020-06-03","2016-12-21","","2021-06-25","Gävle Hospital, Gävle, Gävleborg, 80324, Sweden|Enköping Hospital, Enköping, Uppsala Lan, 74538, Sweden|Uppsala University Hospital, Uppsala, Uppsala Lan, 75185, Sweden|Västmanland Hospital, Västerås, Västmanlands Lan, 72334, Sweden","procedure"

"703","NCT05863312","REtinal Detachment Outcomes Study","RECRUITING","Background: Few large randomized controlled trials provide strong evidence to guide surgical repair of primary rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) repair. The purpose of this factorial, single-blind, randomized controlled trial is to analyze and compare the surgical outcomes, functional visual outcomes, complications, and quality of life associated with RRD repair using (A) pars plana vitrectomy only (PPV) or PPV with scleral buckle (PPV-SB) and (B) sulfur hexafluoride gas (SF6) or perfluoropropane gas (C3F8) tamponade.

Methods: Eligible patients with moderately complex RRD will be randomized 1:1 to PPV or PPV-SB and 1:1 to SF6 or C3F8 gas tamponade. Approximately 560 patients will be recruited to be able to detect a difference of around 10% in SSAS rate between groups. Patients will be followed using multimodal imaging and quality of life questionnaires before and after the surgical repair until 1 year postoperative. The primary outcome will be single surgery anatomic success (SSAS), defined as absence of reoperation for recurrent RRD in the operating room. Secondary outcomes will be pinhole visual acuity (PHVA) at 8-10 weeks and 6 months, final best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), final retina status (i.e., attached or detached), time to onset of RRD recurrence, severity and number of complications, and questionnaire results.

Discussion: This will be the first 2 × 2 factorial randomized controlled trial examining repair techniques in primary RRD. It will also be the first randomized controlled trial to compare gas tamponade between the two most common agents. Notably, it will be adequately powered to detect a clinically significant effect size. The use of multimodal imaging will also be a novel aspect of this study, allowing us to compare head-to-head the impact of adding an SB to the retina's recovery after RRD repair and of differing gas tamponades. Until now, the treatment of RRD has been largely guided by pragmatic retrospective cohort studies. There is a lack of strong evidence guiding therapeutic decisions and this trial will address (1) whether supplemental SB is justified and (2) whether longer duration gas tamponade with C3F8 is necessary.","NO","Retinal Detachment","PROCEDURE: Pars plana vitrectomy|PROCEDURE: Pars plana vitrectomy with scleral buckle|OTHER: Sulfur hexafluoride gas tamponade|OTHER: Perfluoropropane gas","Single surgery anatomic success, Freedom from reoperation for recurrent RRD, Until final 1 year follow-up","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,560,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: FACTORIAL|Masking: TRIPLE (PARTICIPANT, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT","2023-09-26","2027-07","2028-07","2023-05-18","","2023-11-18","Hôpital du Saint-Sacrement, CHU de Québec - Université Laval, Québec, Quebec, G1S4L8, Canada","procedure"

"705","NCT02690012","Feasibility of Using an Integrated Consent Model to Compare Two Standard of Care Regimens for the Management of Hypomagnesemia From Anti-Cancer Therapies","COMPLETED","Hypomagnesemia (hMg) is a common side effect of important anti-cancer therapies such as epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors (EGFRIs) and platinum-containing anti-cancer drugs. EGFRIs, including cetuximab (cmab) and panitumumab (pmab), have been estimated to cause hMg in over 18% and 27% of patients respectively1, while 90% of patients receiving cisplatin will develop hMg if left untreated. The development of severe hMg may result in increased symptoms such as fatigue, neuromuscular changes, mental status changes and cardiac arrhythmias which could result in treatment delays and may compromise treatment efficacy. Despite the common occurrence of this toxicity, little is known regarding the optimal magnesium management strategy. As physicians do not know what the ""best"" treatment for patients is, genuine uncertainty (""clinical equipoise"") exists. Physicians will choose between different ""standards"" of magnesium replacement in their personal practice, using idiosyncratic decision making processes, without the physician or the patient knowing the optimal option. This is not good for patients, physicians and society as a whole. Determining the optimal treatment remains an important medical issue for patients, physicians and society. This study will use a novel method to allow comparisons of established standard of care prophylactic treatment using the ""integrated consent model"" as part of a pragmatic clinical trial7. By integrating medical and clinical practices, physicians will be able to inform their patients about the randomized control trial, akin to a typical conversation between the physician and patient, without written informed consent. This clinical interaction would then be documented, as ordinarily done in practice. Medical and clinical practice will be intertwined with the patients' welfare at the forefront of our best interests.","NO","Hypomagnesemia","OTHER: Magnesium Oxide|OTHER: Magnesium Citrate","Percentage of participants who are eligible and agree to participate in RCT., one year|Percentage of medical oncologists who agree to participate in the study at study commencement and approach patients for the study., one year","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,15,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","2016-07","2019-03","2019-03","2016-02-24","","2019-09-06","The Ottawa Hospital Cancer Centre, Ottawa, Ontario, K1H8L6, Canada","other"

In year 1, we're engaging community members (community members who have experience being community peer advisors or have high blood pressure) to develop the study interventions and protocols. In years 2-5, the investigators will test the interventions.

Year 2-5, Aim 3: Enroll 80 practices and 25 African American patients with uncontrolled HTN at each practice (total n=2000) in a cluster-randomized, controlled, 4-arm pragmatic implementation trial to evaluate the three multi- component, multi-level functional interventions finalized in the UH2 phase compared with enhanced usual care.

The study's 4 arms are:

1. Enhanced Usual Care: Practices are provided with educational materials and tools to enhance patient care
2. Peer Coaching: Patients enrolled in these practices will be matched with a peer coach. The peer coach helps the patient to set goals around self-management, including medications, home monitoring, and diet and exercise, and she helps the patient to strategize how to accomplish the goals, using motivational interviewing techniques
3. Practice Facilitation: Practices randomized to this arm will work with a practice facilitator. Practice facilitation is a highly customized, staged approach to helping a practice to implement process and structural changes to enhance the quality of care and improve patient and staff satisfaction
4. Peer coaching and practice facilitation: Practices randomized to this arm will receive both the peer coach intervention and the practice facilitation intervention.

"715","NCT04043468","Audit and Feedback Interventions With Primary Care Nursing Teams","WITHDRAWN","Audit and feedback (A\&F) aims to improve practices by providing professionals with a summary of their performance. A major limitation to its effectiveness is a persistent intention-action gap following the feedback that prevents the translation of planned actions into concrete changes in practice. In nursing, the lack of coordination within nursing teams contributes to this gap and therefore limits their capacity for action. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of an A\&F intervention enhanced with an action support component on the primary care nursing teams' capacity to improve performance compared to a standard A\&F intervention.

A pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial with analysis of implementation fidelity will be conducted. Four nursing organizations will receive standard A\&F, while the other four will receive A\&F with a support component. We will measure performance using clinical administrative data from an electronic database based on wound care episodes. Performance indicators will be measured 3 times: at the beginning of the study (T1), after 6 months (T2) and after 12 months (T3). The feedback meetings will take place between times 1 and 2, then between times 2 and 3. The intervention group will receive the support component in the form of structured focus groups in addition to the feedback meetings. Changes in rates of seven nursing-sensitive indicators (continuity, planning and adjusting of the treatment plan, initial assessment, education, frequency and number of consultations and duration of episodes) will be measured to evaluate the effects of A\&F on performance.

The results are expected to inform of the effectiveness of A\&F in order to improve its design and deployment. The potential impact on the improvement of practices is significant, considering that wound care is one of the main conditions in primary care for which nursing staff have a high degree of autonomy.","NO","Nurse's Role","OTHER: Audit and feedback","Continuity, Percentage of care episodes in which at least 50 % of the consultations are provided by the same professional, Change from baseline continuity at 6 and 12 months.|Planning and adjusting of the treatment plan, Percentage of care episodes in which at least 75 % of the consultations are with an RN, Change from baseline Planning and adjusting of the treatment plan at 6 and 12 months.|Education, Percentage of care episodes in which at least one education session is provided, Change from baseline Education at 6 and 12 months.|Initial assessment, Percentage of care episodes in which a RN performs a wound assessment in the first consultation, Change from baseline Initial assessment at 6 and 12 months.|Frequency, Percentage of care episodes with no more than three consultations per week as of the second week, Change from baseline Frequency at 6 and 12 months.|Duration, Percentage of care episodes lasting 42 days or less, Change from baseline Duration at 6 and 12 months.|Intensity, Percentage of care episodes with no more than 22 consultations, Change from baseline Intensity at 6 and 12 months.","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,0,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE (PARTICIPANT, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","2021-09-02","2023-09-02","2024-09-02","2019-08-02","","2021-01-27","","other"

However, empirical evidence is limited on strategies to enhance the effectiveness of care for CKD. The objective of the trial is to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of multicomponent primary care strategies in preserving kidney function among patients with CKD at primary care clinics in Singapore.

Methods: A pragmatic, randomized controlled trial, in 4 socioeconomically diverse primary care clinics (polyclinics) in Singapore over 3 years. A total of 896 participants with CKD Stage 3 or worse aged ≥40 and \<80 years will be enrolled, with 224 from each polyclinic. Participants enrolled in each polyclinic will be randomly allocated to the intervention or usual care group in a 1:1 ratio.

Intervention includes four components 1) training nurses as health coaches for motivational conversation and CKD specific lifestyle counseling on diet and exercise, using hybrid follow-up approach of in-person, telephone, and secure WhatsApp video meetings; 2)Training physicians in algorithm-based standardized management of CKD and hybrid care delivery;3) subsidy on sodium-glucose transport protein-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) for CKD; and 4) regular CKD case review meetings.

"727","NCT04408690","Feasibility of a RCT That Compares Immediate Versus Optional Delayed Surgical Repair After ACL Injury","COMPLETED","Currently, most patients with an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury undergo surgery. There is a general belief that surgical reconstruction is necessary to return to sport safely and to limit premature knee osteoarthrosis or additional meniscal damage. However, there is unsufficient scientific evidence for this belief. Moreover, several studies show that a reconstruction does not guarantee successful return to sports or the prevention of osteoarthritis or meniscal injuries at all. Therefore, an immediate surgery after an ACL injury is more and more questioned. The only qualitative RCT that exists (KANON trial) could not demonstrate that an immediate reconstruction is an added value (in terms of symptoms, knee function, activity level, osteoarthritis or incidental meniscal damage) compared to a conservative approach consisting of progressive rehabilitation and delayed surgery if there was persistent knee instability.

In a future multicenter RCT the investigators want to 1) verify these results and 2) search for predictors that predict which patients from the conservative group do well without delayed surgery. This information is invaluable to physicians as it allows them to decide which treatment is best for the patient.

Before performing a large, adequately-powered RCT that compares both treatment options, the investigators will run a pilot study that assesses the feasibility to recruit ACL patients for such RCT. This seems necessary, as many patients still believe that timely surgery is a prerequisite for restoring knee function, for returning to sports and for preventing cartilage degeneration. These preferences for surgery might affect recruitment and adherence to the protocol. Therefore, a pilot study will performed that demonstrates whether a large RCT is feasible with regard to 1) participant recruitment, 2) adherence to the treatment arm they were allocated to and 3) protocol feasibility. The findings of this pilot study will help deciding about progressing to a future definitive RCT.","NO","Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries","PROCEDURE: Immediate anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction|OTHER: Rehabilitation|PROCEDURE: Optional delayed anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction","Feasibility to recruit patients: Number of eligible patients that sign the informed consent, Number of eligible patients that sign the informed consent, 4 months after first patient in","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT","PHASE3",29,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE (INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT","2020-09-15","2023-03-03","2023-03-03","2020-05-29","","2023-11-15","UZ Leuven, Leuven, 3000, Belgium|CHU Liège, Liège, 4000, Belgium","procedure"

There are, however, few studies on the effects of energy healing for cancer and cancer associated symptoms and none of them are of a volume or quality that allows reliable conclusions to be drawn. Qualitative studies on energy healing in Denmark have demonstrated that the interventions are individualized and the expected outcomes personalized. This research points to the need for a research design that can evaluate personalized outcomes of individualized treatments and at the same time adhere to general demands of external and internal validity.

The objective of this study is to test the effectiveness of energy healing as an individualized rehabilitative intervention to improve outcomes of personal choice among persons who have completed a conventional intended curative treatment for colorectal, breast and prostate cancer. The study is designed as a pragmatic clinical trial with personalized outcomes.

The study attempts to maximize external validity by using a design that incorporates important features of energy healing administered in real-life settings: 1a) allowing participants self-selection to healing and non-healing control, 1b) assessing individual participant-selected treatment goals, 1c) allowing the treatment to be performed in the private clinics of the healers. To maximize internal validity similar to that obtained in a randomized, clinical trial design, the study will 2a) randomize participants to self-selection and randomized groups of intervention and control; and 2b) supplement the assessment of personalized treatment goals with assessment of outcomes with standardized measures.

The study will account for a number of possible moderators of the effects, including 3a) socio-demographics and 3b) previous experience with complementary and alternative treatment. Outcome measures will be assessed by questionnaires, physical measurements, data from administrative registries as well as semi-structured interviews and participant observation. Possible patterns in the various forms of data will be examined for concordances and discrepancies.

Parents who smoke are often medically underserved and visit their child's doctor more than their own; 25% of all adult smokers have children seen in child healthcare. When parents quit smoking, their life expectancy is increased by more than 10 years, tobacco-related poor pregnancy outcomes are eliminated, children's risk of becoming smokers decreases 4-fold, families have more money for necessities, and children are less likely to suffer from diseases caused by tobacco smoke exposure.

Despite free tobacco cessation services in every province and widespread insurance coverage of NRT, parental tobacco screening and cessation support rarely happens in pediatric care, thus there is potential for major health benefits from a routinely delivered tobacco control program to parents in this setting.

The investigators will conduct a 12-month single centre, pragmatic, single-blind pilot RCT of CEASE vs. usual care of 70 parents who use cigarettes and/or vaping products whose children are seen in pediatric clinics at the CHU Sainte-Justine. A similar trial, CEASE-A will be conducted with 70 adolescents ages 14-17.

Objectives:

1. Perform a pilot RCT of the Clinical Effort Against Secondhand Smoke (CEASE) intervention in Canada. CEASE is an evidence-based parental smoking cessation intervention to ensure that every parent who uses cigarettes and/or nicotine vaping products and visits their child's pediatrician receives nicotine dependence treatment
2.

"737","NCT01187069","A Practice-nurse Addressed Intervention to Improve Type 2 Diabetes Care","COMPLETED","A huge challenge in type 2-diabetes care is how to motivate patients towards health behaviour changes. In Denmark, the tendency is that nurses in general practice provide a large part of type 2 diabetes care.

Observational studies support Self-determination Theory by finding autonomous motivation and perceived competence associated with improved HbA1c-levels in patients with type 2 diabetes. Hence, research is needed to develop and test interventions that are autonomy supportive.

Aim To develop a training course for practice-nurses in autonomy support in patients with type 2 diabetes, and to evaluate the effect on patient outcomes.

Methods The development of the intervention was based on literature research and expert meetings. The intervention is evaluated in a cluster randomised controlled trial with 40 Danish general practices,

* where nurses, before enrolment in the study, provided consultations to patients with type 2 diabetes,
* and about 2500 patients with type 2 diabetes, identified in a Diabetes Database.

The patients will be followed 15 months from nurse-participation in the course. Data will be obtained from registers and patient-questionnaires.

"743","NCT01745068","Partnership for Applied Research in Fracture Prevention Programs for the Elderly","UNKNOWN","During their lifetime, approximately 50% of Canadian women and 30% of Canadian men will experience at least one fracture due to bone fragility (FF). Evidence is growing regarding prevention programs' effectiveness to prevent falls, but prevention of fractures through fall prevention programs has enjoyed limited success. Falls prevention programs and post-fracture screening programs leading to pharmacological treatment are very different strategies, with a shared ultimate goal. Coordination between those who repair fractures and those who manage the patient to prevent the next fracture is critical. The overarching aim of this proposal is to generate evidence-based knowledge about the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an integrated FF prevention program, as well as a portrait of the barriers and facilitating factors for such programs. More specifically, the objectives are: 1) to combine existing fall prevention and post-fracture management programs in the province of Quebec into integrated FF prevention programs; 2) to compare the performance of these integrated programs to control sites, using a pragmatic study design; 3) to identify barriers as well as factors that improve effectiveness across different implementation milieu; and 4) to develop and engage in active knowledge transfer activities in Quebec regions where integrated FF prevention programs are neither adequately nor successfully implemented. Drawing upon the literature on integrated healthcare, fall and fracture prevention, we hypothesize that an integrated FF program can reduce the risk of a subsequent fracture by at least 30% in the population of interest. The proposed team is poised to develop new interdisciplinary collaborations among healthcare practitioners and decision makers involved in the prevention of FFs. The program is built upon existing healthcare and structures and programs and in turn, will truly measure the effectiveness of an integrated FF prevention program. The results will ultimately lead to improvements in the existing knowledge base, address policy-relevant and health systems problems, and assist in the design and implementation of FFs prevention programs.","NO","Osteoporosis With Current Fragility Fracture","OTHER: Integrated program","Incidence of secondary fragility fracture, 18 months post recruitment","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,631,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: NON_RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","2013-01","2016-11","2019-06","2012-12-07","","2018-10-29","Centre hospitalier Hôtel-Dieu d'Amos, Amos, Quebec, J9T 2S2, Canada|CSSS du Roché Percé (Centre hospitalier de Chandler), Chandler, Quebec, G0C 1K0, Canada|Hôpital de Hull, Gatineau, Quebec, J8Y 1W7, Canada|Hôpital Charles Lemoyne, Greenfield Park, Quebec, J4V 2H1, Canada|Hôpital Maisonneuve-Rosemont, Montreal, Quebec, H1T 2M4, Canada|Hôpital Jean-Talon, Montreal, Quebec, H2E1S6, Canada|Hôpital Sacré-Coeur de Montréal, Montreal, Quebec, H4J 1C5, Canada|Centre hospitalier régional de Lanaudière, Saint-Charles-Borromée, Quebec, J6E 6J2, Canada|Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, Quebec, J1H5N4, Canada|CSSS de St-Jérôme (Hôpital régional de St-Jérôme), St-Jérôme, Quebec, J7Z 5T3, Canada","other"

The overall aim is consistent with the NIDDK's Behavioral/Prevention Research Program's focus on individual, family, and community-based strategies for prevention of diabetes and its complications. While evidence of lifestyle interventions that increase physical activity and improve eating habits to achieve modest weight loss in delaying and preventing the onset of type 2 diabetes continues to mount, the translation of these interventions into effective programs to health care settings with modest resources remains a challenge. The proposed research project will conduct a pragmatic clinical trial that employs a hybrid Preference/Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) designed to compare two technology-enhanced diabetes prevention programs in achieving objectively verified weight loss relative to a standard care control at comparatively lower costs. Adult patients (18 years of age and older) at risk for developing diabetes will be randomized to either the Choice group or the Randomization group. Those patients randomized to the Choice group (n=240) will have the opportunity to choose one of two programs to participate in: 1. A 2-hour Small-Group (SG) session, with automated interactive voice response (IVR) systems targeting personal action planning to support lifestyle change and weight loss over a period of 12 months; or 2.

Enhanced standard-care (SC). SC includes the referral to a currently offered pre-diabetes class. Primary outcome measures include weight loss, cost, and reach of each program. Secondary outcome measures include physical activity behavior; eating behavior; and process evaluation. It is hypothesized that both the SG/IVR and the DVD/IVR interventions will produce significantly greater amounts of weight loss at 6, 12, and 18 months following program initiation than SC but will not differ from one another.

"755","NCT03057769","Effect of Papillary Epinephrine Spraying on Post-ERCP Pancreatitis in Patients Received Rectal Indomethacin","TERMINATED","Acute pancreatitis is the most common and feared complication of ERCP, occurring after 1% to 30% of procedures. It accounts for substantial morbidity and represents a substantial cost to health-care systems. European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and Japanese Society of Hepato-Biliary-Pancreatic surgery guidelines and recently large-scale RCT recommended routine use of NSAIDs indomethacin rectally before ERCP. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been shown to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, phospholipase A2 activity, and neutrophil/endothelial cell attachment, which is believed to play a key role in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis.

Other possible mechanisms have been suggested in the occurrence of pancreatitis. Papillary edema caused by manipulations during cannulation or endoscopic treatment has received the most attention. The papillary edema may cause temporary outflow obstruction of pancreatic juice, and then increase ductal pressure, resulting in the occurrence of pancreatitis. Topical application of epinephrine on the papilla may reduce papillary edema by decreasing capillary permeability or by relaxing the sphincter of Oddi. A meta-analysis (including 2 existing RCTs and post-hoc analysis of our previous study) of papillary epinephrine spraying compared with saline spraying or no intervention indicates a potential relative risk reduction of PEP (RR 0.34, 95%CI 0.19-0.61). Papillary epinephrine spraying may be an inexpensive and convenient alternative for prevention of post-ERCP pancreatitis. A large pragmatic RCT to determine whether routine using papillary epinephrine spraying can reduce post-ERCP pancreatitis is needed.","NO","Pancreatitis|Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography","DRUG: Papillary epinephrine spraying|DRUG: Papillary saline spraying|DRUG: Indomethacin","Overall post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP), 30 days","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,3300,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: PREVENTION","2017-02-01","2017-10-26","2017-10-26","2017-02-20","","2017-10-27","Department of Gastroenterology, Successful Hospital of Xiamen university, Xiamen, Fujian, 361000, China|Department of Gastroenterology, Zhongshan Hospital of Xiamen university, Xiamen, Fujian, 361004, China|Department of General Surgery, The First Hospital of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, Gansu, 730000, China|Endoscopy Center, Ankang Central Hospital, Ankang, Shaanxi, 725000, China|Xijing Hospital of Digestive Diseases, Xi'an, Shaanxi, 710032, China|Department of Gastroenterology, No. 451 Hospital, Xi'an, Shaanxi, 710068, China|Department of Gastroenterology, The First Affiliated Hospital of the Medical College, Shihezi University, Shihezi, Xinjiang, 832008, China|Department of Gastroenterology, Urumqi General Hospital of Lanzhou Military Region, Urumqi, Xinjiang, 830000, China|Department of Gastroenterology, Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310006, China|Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery, General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan, 750004, China","drug"

The intervention consists of education, lifestyle advice and remote monitoring elements and is based on principles of goal setting, self-efficacy theory and behavioural economics, embedded within a platform supported by motivational features and gamification. The primary endpoint is defined as achieving at least a minimal clinically important difference in arthritis-related self-efficacy (the ASES-score) at the follow-up visit in favour of the intervention group when compared to the control group.

Moreover, although qualitative studies have highlighted concerns among both patients and healthcare professionals that mobile apps might induce illness behaviour by increasing patients' awareness of their symptoms, this has rarely been studied in detail. Consequently, data regarding the effects of remote monitoring on symptom hypervigilance remain limited and conflicting. Therefore, this trial additionally aims to assess (as a key secondary objective) if a mobile app-based intervention is associated with changes in pain catastrophising, as a conceptualisation of hypervigilance to symptoms.","NO","Rheumatoid Arthritis","OTHER: Mobile app-based self-management intervention","Arthritis Self-Efficacy Scale (ASES), Superiority outcome.

Its symptoms, including daily facial pain and headache, an inability to breath through the nose and complete smell loss, regularly impair one's ability to work and to enjoy and participate in daily activities. The annual cost of chronic sinusitis to Canada is estimated at $1.3 billion while the government pays an estimated $860 million yearly for chronic sinusitis treatment. Chronic sinusitis with polyps, the most common type of chronic sinusitis, is usually treated with a combination of medications and surgery. Until now, surgical treatment has only been performed in the operating room, at a cost of about $3500 per procedure. But, recent studies have shown that a new procedure, ""in-clinic polyp removal"", can provide an improvement in patient symptoms to levels equal to those for sinus surgery performed in a hospital operating room. Moreover, in clinic polyp removal has additional advantages including a shorter procedure recovery time, a significantly lower cost to the health care system (about one-tenth the cost or $450), and a shorter wait time for treatment. With the proposed pragmatic trial, the investigators will determine whether the in clinic polyp removal procedure is as good as sinus surgery in the operating room at controlling patient symptoms of chronic sinusitis. The investigators will also determine the cost and health-benefits for a patient, the healthcare system and for society of in clinic polyp removal in comparison to sinus surgery done in a hospital operating room. The investigators will then know if this new treatment, in clinic polyp removal, can replace sinus surgery as the standard of care for these patients.","NO","Sinusitis|Nasal Polyps","PROCEDURE: Endoscopic polypectomy in clinic (EPIC)|PROCEDURE: Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (ESS)|OTHER: General Anesthesia|OTHER: Local and topical anesthesia","Sinonasal Outcome Test-22 (SNOT-22), 3 months","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,140,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT","2017-04-11","2023-12","2025-12","2016-11-29","","2022-09-22","Vancouver General Hospital, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada|St. Joseph's Hospital London, London, Ontario, N6A 4V2, Canada|Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, K1Y 1J8, Canada|McGill University Health Center, Montréal, Quebec, H4A 3J1, Canada","procedure"

"770","NCT03858608","Weight Loss for Uncontrolled Asthma Associated With Elevated BMI","RECRUITING","Weight loss for uncontrolled asthma associated with elevated BMI. Asthma is a common condition with different types recognised that have variable responses to current treatments. It is often poorly controlled and there is a need to discover new treatments. Obesity is common in asthma and is associated with increase in symptoms, poorer asthma control and quality of life, and increased healthcare utilisation and treatment burden. The Counterweight Plus programme is a safe, evidence-based non-surgical intervention that is associated with sustained weight losses of up to 15% in obese individuals but its effects in asthma have not been tested. Our study aims to evaluate the impact of this intervention in individuals with difficult asthma associated with obesity.

The Counterweight Plus programme includes a total diet replacement (TDR) phase (12 weeks) followed by structured food reintroduction (6 weeks) and long term weight loss maintenance (34 weeks) and will be provided by Dieticians trained in the delivery of this intervention. Participants will attend fortnightly clinic reviews with Dieticians during the first 18 weeks and then monthly clinic reviews during the weight loss maintenance period.

Participants will be randomised to Counterweight Plus programme or usual care (control) and followed for 1 year with study visits at baseline, 4 months and 1 year. During study visits participants will be invited to complete questionnaires, provide a blood sample, perform breathing tests and a walking test, and wear an activity monitor for one week.

If the Counterweight Plus programme is proven to be of benefit in this patient group, this may lead to service development so that this intervention may be made available to similar patients in the future within the clinical setting.","NO","Asthma|Obesity","DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Counterweight Plus|OTHER: Usual asthma care","Asthma Control overall change, Change in score of ACQ6 (Asthma Control Questionnaire 6) in intervention group versus usual care group.

In the current proposal, the investigators aim to assess the efficacy and safety of early discontinuation of antibiotic therapy in adult patients infected with respiratory viruses.

A general recommendation to treat all instances of community acquired pneumonia (CAP) patients with antibiotics leads to significant antibiotic overtreatment. In 2008, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the first multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay for the detection of multiple respiratory virus nucleic acids simultaneously. The wide availability of such nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) for rapid viral detection together with chest radiographs has the potential to define patients who can be managed without antibiotics.

Akershus University Hospital is one of the largest hospitals in Norway, with a catchment area of more than 550,000 people. In 2012 to 2013, the majority of patients admitted to Akershus University Hospital with suspected CAP and a positive viral NAAT were treated with antibiotics, a prescription pattern representing antibiotic overtreatment. The investigators accordingly hypothesize that discontinuation of antibiotic therapy in patients with moderately severe disease and airway sample positive for respiratory viruses is safe and non-inferior to continuation of antibiotic therapy.","NO","Infectious Disease|Influenza|Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)|Respiratory Tract Infections","OTHER: Stop antibiotic therapy","Early clinical response, Survival with symptom improvement without receipt of rescue antibacterial therapy, 120 hours after randomization","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT","PHASE4",380,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT","2022-01-13","2025-05","2029-11","2021-09-16","","2024-01-16","Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, 5021, Norway|Drammen Hospital, Vestre Viken Hospital Trust, Drammen, 3004, Norway|Akershus University Hospital, Lørenskog, 1478, Norway|Oslo University Hospital, Ullevål, Oslo, 0424, Norway|Stavanger University Hospital, Stavanger, 4068, Norway|University Hospital of North Norway, Tromsø, 9038, Norway|St. Olavs hospital, Trondheim, 7006, Norway|Sykehuset i Vestfold HF, Tønsberg, 3103, Norway","other"

Within the trial, telehealth indicates that patients are followed-up outside health-care facilities using information and communication technologies (ICTs). Patients who are followed up using telehealth solutions can answer questions about their own health and/or perform measurements related to their health (e.g. blood pressure, blood glucose, oxygen measurement, weight) via a tablet according to a personalized schedule. The measurement values are transferred from the measuring devices to a tablet so that the users can easily see them and track their results over time. The results are also transmitted digitally to a follow-up service, a healthcare center with nurses, who contacts the patient when needed. The follow-up service provides medical support and guidance based on the patient's needs and planned follow-up, and will, in consultation with the user, evaluate whether the user should contact the general practitioner (GP) or emergency room.

The study population of the trial includes users with comprehensive medical needs, with medium to high risk of worsening of their condition, hospitalization or increased need for health and care services.

They may work long hours, experience stress directly related to the emotional demands of the role and clinical responsibility, experience physical and psychological burnout and may experience high rates of workplace violence. Poorer wellbeing and high burnout amongst mental health staff has been associated with poorer quality of patient care, higher absenteeism, higher turnover rates, and low morale. Virtual reality (VR) relaxation is a technique whereby experiences of pleasant/ calming environments are accessed via a head mounted display to promote relaxation. The use of VR relaxation facilities in the workplace may provide a pragmatic approach to enabling employees to de-stress, relax and optimise their mental wellbeing and may reduce turnover and improve stress related sick leave across the National Health Service (NHS) workforce.

The research will involve a pre-post-test of 5-weeks of VR relaxation for clinical staff working in mental health settings, including those working in inpatient settings and community teams. The pre-post-test will act as a feasibility trial, the primary aim is thereby to determine whether VR relaxation is feasible and acceptable amongst mental health staff. This feasibility study will evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a 5-week course of weekly 20-minute sessions of VR relaxation for clinical staff.

Design: 24-month, parallel, open-label, multicentre, pragmatic, hybrid type 1 randomized clinical trial.

Setting, sample, and randomization: 118 primary healthcare centers from multiple regions in Spain will be randomly assigned (ratio 1:1) to two groups (control and intervention). The intervention group will receive two audits (baseline and intermediate at 12 months). The audits will consist of the administration of the PREOS-PC questionnaire (a measure of patient-reported patient safety) to a sample of around 100 patients per center. The intervention group will receive reports on the results of both audits, along with resources aimed at facilitating the design and implementation of safety improvement plans. The intervention will be deployed through the SinergiAPS web tool, developed and validated in previous projects. The control group will have access to the intervention after the end of the clinical trial (waitlist).

"783","NCT03407638","PRimary Care Opioid Use Disorders Treatment (PROUD) Trial","COMPLETED","Effective treatment for opioid use disorders (OUDs) requires medications. Two medications for treating OUDs-buprenorphine and injectable naltrexone-can be prescribed in primary care (PC). However, despite the current opioid epidemic and expert recommendations that OUDs should be treated in PC, most PC clinics do not offer treatment for OUDs. This reflects a lack of consensus among health system leaders and clinicians that OUDs should be treated in PC.

The PRimary care Opioid Use Disorders treatment (PROUD) Trial is a pragmatic cluster-randomized, quality improvement trial that evaluates implementation of a team-based approach to PC supported by a full time nurse (the ""PROUD intervention""). This type of team-based PC is often referred to as ""collaborative care"" for management of OUDs in PC, and this type of trial is often referred to as a Hybrid Type III implementation trial.

The trial is being conducted in 6 diverse health systems spanning 5 states (New York, Florida, Michigan, Texas, and Washington), with 2 PC clinics in each system randomized. One clinic is randomly selected to implement the PROUD intervention and the other continues usual PC (UPC).

The overall objective of the PROUD trial is to provide information to guide health system leaders who are faced with the decision of whether or not to treat OUDs in PC, by evaluating the benefits of implementing the PROUD intervention that integrates high quality OUD treatment (i.e. buprenorphine or injectable naltrexone) into the normal flow of PC.

The primary objective of the PROUD trial is to evaluate whether the PROUD intervention increases OUD treatment with buprenorphine or injectable naltrexone, documented in the electronic health records (EHRs) of PC patients, over a 2 year follow-up, as compared to UPC.

The primary hypothesis is that there will be a significant increase in the number of patient-days of medication treatment for OUDs documented in the EHR of PC patients in the 2 years after clinics are randomized to the PROUD intervention compared to PC clinics randomized to UPC. This implementation objective reflects whether the PROUD intervention increases initiation of and/or retention in OUD treatment, documented in EHRs within medical settings.

The main secondary objective is to test the hypothesis that PC patients with OUDs documented in their EHRs in the 3 years prior to randomization who receive care in PROUD intervention clinics, compared to those who receive care in UPC clinics, will have fewer days of acute care utilization (including urgent care, emergency department \[ED\] and hospital care) in the 2 years after randomization.

In primary prevention, in hypertensive patients at high cardiovascular risk (+ at least 2 risk factors), the gap is secondary to 1) the ignorance of the validated therapeutic targets and strategies, 2) the absence of global cardiovascular risk management, 3) the usual ambulatory medical practice, which is not adapted to a global cardiovascular prevention approach.

Objectives Principal. To demonstrate that a series of 5 specific prevention consultations over 2 years allows a greater number of hypertensive patients at high cardiovascular risk to reach the goals set by guidelines with no deterioration of their quality of life compared with no particular intervention.

Method Pragmatic, cluster-randomised controlled trial. At least 1904 high cardiovascular risk hypertensive patients will be included and followed up during two years by 268 teaching general practitioners from 23 regional teaching colleges. The regional teaching colleges will be randomised to avoid a contamination bias. The study will be coordinated by local coordinators at the college level.

Intervention In the intervention group, the investigators will have training, information, and feed back regarding the management of high risk hypertensive patients. The training will concern the targets to be reached, therapeutic strategies recommended by the AFSSAPS/HAS, and scientific data. The investigators will have an easy guide that can be used during consultations, and will be informed about tobacco withdrawal programs and education for improving diet, exercise and compliance.

In the control group, investigators will care for their patients as usual.

Often such ""triggers"" for escalation are initiated based on the nursing evaluation of the patient, followed by physician history and physical exam, then augmented based on laboratory values. These ""triggers"" can enhance the care of patients without increasing the workload of responder teams. One of the goals in hospital medicine is the earlier identification of patients that require an escalation of care. The study team developed a model through a retrospective analysis of the historical data from the Mount Sinai Data Warehouse (MSDW), which can provide machine learning based triggers for escalation of care (Approved by: IRB-18-00581). This model is called ""Medical Early Warning Score ++"" (MEWS ++). This IRB seeks to prospectively validate the developed model through a pragmatic clinical trial of using these alerts to trigger an evaluation for appropriateness of escalation of care on two general inpatients wards, one medical and one surgical. These alerts will not change the standard of care. They will simply suggest to the care team that the patient should be further evaluated without specifying a subsequent specific course of action.

"802","NCT06309654","Home-Based Circuit Training in Overweight/Obese Older Adult Patients With Knee Osteoarthritis and Type 2 Diabetes","COMPLETED","Background: Obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are considered two of the most prevalent metabolic diseases linked to the onset of knee pain caused by osteoarthritis. Regular exercise has been documented as a principal component of a prevention, management, and treatment strategy for knee osteoarthritis (KOA) patients. However, evidence-based exercise protocols for individuals with comorbidities such as obesity, T2DM, and KOA are scarce. Thus, the present pragmatic randomized controlled trial aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a 12-week home-based circuit training (HBCT) protocol on various indicators related to KOA and cardiometabolic health among overweight/obese older adult patients with KOA and T2DM during the COVID-19 lockdown. Methods: Seventy overweight or obese patients with KOA and T2DM (62.2 ± 6.1 years; 56% female) were randomly assigned to the intervention group (n = 35, HBCT) or the no-exercise control group (n = 35, CON). HBCT performed a progressive protocol (seven exercises; 15-30 repetitions per exercise, 1 min passive rest between exercises; 2-4 rounds per session; 20-60 min total session duration). The knee injury and osteoarthritis symptoms, cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors, cardiorespiratory fitness, and renal function were assessed at baseline and following the 12-week intervention. Results: HBCT significantly improved HBCT improved the vast majority of outcomes related to cardiometabolic health and knee osteoarthritis symptoms compared to CON (p\<0.05). No significant differences were detected in total bilirubin, sodium, urea, resting heart rate, or KOOS-sport between HBCT and CON. Conclusion: These findings suggest that an injury-free HBCT program may improve several cardiometabolic health- and KOA-related indices in overweight/obese patients with T2DM and KOA. Such results may encourage clinicians and practitioners to adopt real-world exercise training approaches when prescribing physical exercise to patients characterized by impaired metabolic and musculoskeletal health.","NO","Aerobic Exercise|Strength Training|Glycemic Control|Blood Pressure|Oxidative Stress|Metabolic Syndrome","BEHAVIORAL: 12-week home-based circuit training (HBCT)|BEHAVIORAL: Standard of care (CONT)","Blood pressure, systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure, end of 12 week|The A1C test, end of 12 week|blood oxygen levels, oxygen level was quantify using SpO2, end of 12 week|cardiorespiratory fitness, a 6-minute walk test (6MWT), end of 12 week|interleukin 6 (IL-6), an interleukin that acts as both a pro-inflammatory cytokine and an anti-inflammatory myokine will be measured using Human ELISA Kit #P05231 and # P00441, respectively, end of 12 week|Superoxide dismutases (SOD), enzyme that alternately catalyzes the dismutation (or partitioning) of the superoxide will be measured using g Plasma IL-6 and SOD levels, end of 12 week","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,70,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT","2021-09-13","2023-09-13","2023-12-29","2024-03-13","","2024-03-13","Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University, Riyadh, 11671, Saudi Arabia","behavioral"

Objectives \& Hypothesis Overactive bladder (OAB) affects over 10 million adults in the United States and each year substantial costs are incurred from private and public funds to test the efficacy of new and existing drugs for OAB.14 However, effectiveness and adherence data from traditional clinical trials are not generalizable to clinical practice.3, 4 In an era of limited resources and competing demands, it is essential that cost-effectiveness data from clinical trials be generalizable to the clinical world. Pragmatic clinical trials measure the effectiveness of treatments in real clinical practice, and in the full spectrum of patients that require treatment.5 Pragmatic trials require patient reported outcomes that are valid but have low patient burden.5 The conduct of pragmatic clinical trials for OAB has been limited by a lack of instruments that have demonstrable validity and reliability in the typical clinical setting Pill counts, used to measure primary outcomes in most traditional trials, are burdensome in the clinical setting.1610 The optimal instrument for measuring utility scores, general quality of life scores for cost-effectiveness analyses for OAB, is also not known.

Although poor adherence carries the potential for continued suffering for patients and wasted health care resources, there is a lack of data on the clinical and economic impact of poor adherence to treatment for OAB in real-world clinical practice. We have published preliminary data that underscores the role of adherence and utilities in the treatment of OAB. 3 Our hypothesis is that effectiveness, adherence, and utility preference scores can be measured using pragmatic patient reported instruments and that poor adherence is associated with lower effectiveness and quality of life in adults with OAB in a clinical setting. Specifically, the overriding goal of this proposal is to validate pragmatic instruments to measure effectiveness, adherence and utility preference scores and obtain preliminary data on the effect of adherence and quality of life in adults undergoing treatment for overactive bladder in a clinical setting.","NO","Overactive Bladder","DRUG: Toviaz","Clinical effectiveness The primary outcome for clinical effectiveness will be patient reported improvement in urinary urgency at 3 months compared to before start of treatment.

Radial shockwave (RSW) is one of the most common treatment for MFS. However, a recent systematic review found very low-level evidence to support its short-term benefit, due to poor methodological qualities. The authors therefore recommended further large scale, good quality placebo-controlled trials (RCT) in this area. Further still, previous studies have not considered the experiences of patient regarding this intervention.

Study Objectives: To determine the effectiveness of RSW compared to placebo for the treatment of patients with MPS in neck and upper back, and to establish the experiences of patients receiving the treatment.

Research Questions: Is RSW therapy more effective at improving MPS compared to a placebo? What are the experiences of patients with MPS receiving this treatment?

Methods: A pragmatic double blind RCT to investigate the effectiveness of RSW on patients with MPS and a semi-structured-interview to investigate the patients' experience of receiving the treatment.

Sample: 120 potential participants with MPS for the RCT and 20 participants for the semi-structured qualitative interview.

Interventions: The Intervention group will receive a total of 6 sessions of RSW following manufacturer's parameters: 1.5 bar, pulses 2000, frequency 15 Hz (Time 3 minutes). The Control group will receive an identical treatment except that the they will receive a no energy shock of 0.3 bar, frequency 15 and no pulses.

Outcome measures: Improvements in the patient's numeric pain scale (NPS), neck disability index (NDI), pressure pain threshold (PPT) and SF-12 questionnaires at 4, 8 and 12 weeks' follow-up between the two groups.

It allows patients to measure their level of pain accordingly using a whole number (0-10 integers) that corresponds to their pain intensity (Rodriguez, 2001). The scale is considered reliable (accurate and consistent), responsive (ability to detect clinically significant changes) and valid (actually measures what it sets out to) (Hawker, 2011). Accordingly, a pain reduction of 2 points, or 30%, on the NPRS scores is defined as Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID) \[Childs et al, 2005; Farrar et al, 2001\]. The NPS is relatively easy to comprehend, and to apply, especially by patients with musculoskeletal disorders (Hawker, 2011)., 12 weeks|Neck Disability Index (NDI), It is the most commonly used self-rated disability score for assessing patients with neck pain Vernon \& Mior (1991). It consists of ten domains: pain intensity, personal care, lifting, reading, headaches, concentration, work, driving, sleeping and recreation. Each question contains six answer choices, scored from 0 (no disability) to 5 (complete disability). All sections are then totalled. Scoring is reported on a 0-50 scale, 0 being the best possible score and 50 being the worst. The score can also be reported as a percentage (0-100%). The Minimum Detectable Change (90% confidence) is 5 points or 10% points Vernon \& Mior (1991), and the MCID is in the range of 3.5-5.0 points (Pool et al, 2007)., 12 weeks|Pressure pain threshold (PPT), It will be measured using a digital algometer and pain score measurement will be performed with digital palpation. The algometer circular flat tip with 1.0 cm2 surface will be slowly pushed vertically to the skin over the trigger points until the participants interprets the compression on skin as pain sensation. The exerted pressure will be enlarged at a rate of 1 kg/cm2. Participants will be requested to inform the treating physiotherapist by saying ""yes"" when the pain is perceived. The measurements will be taken three times with 40 seconds intervals, and the mean average value will be taken (Fischer, 1998). A mean difference of 0.94 kg/cm2 in PPT was defined as MCID (Asiri et al, 2020)., 12 weeks|SF12 - Quality of life (QoL), Quality of life status will be evaluated using the short form (SF12), which is a shorter version of SF-36 questionnaire. The health survey (SF-12) questionnaire, consists of 12 items regarding the quality of life with respect to the physical and emotional aspects. Likert scales and yes/no options were used to assess function and wellbeing on this 12-item questionnaire. To score the SF-12, scales are standardized with a scoring algorithm to obtain a score ranging from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate better health status. It is one of the most widely used patient report outcome with well documented high validity, reliability, and responsiveness rate among many groups varying by age, sex, socio-economic status, geographical region, and clinical conditions (Ware et al, 2000)., 12 weeks","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,120,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE (PARTICIPANT, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT","2022-04-21","2022-12","2023-03","2022-05-19","","2022-05-26","Physical Rehabilitation Department, King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre, Riyadh, 11211, Saudi Arabia","device"

"820","NCT01870154","Effectiveness of an Intervention for Prevention and Treatment of Burnout in Primary Care","COMPLETED","Background: Burnout syndrome is an important health problem that affects many professionals and must be addressed globally, with both organizational measures and personal interventions. Burnout of health professionals can be prevented in order to avoid personal, familial, and social consequences, as well as repercussions for patients.

Methods/Design: This work describes a protocol for a controlled, pragmatic, randomized clinical trial in 2 parallel groups: intervention and control. All health professionals from 7 health care centers (HCCs) will form the intervention group, and all health professionals from 7 different HCCs will form the control group. The intervention group will receive 16 hours of training at their work place. The Maslach's burnout inventory (MBI), burnout physician Questionnaire (CDPM) or burnout nurse Questionnaire (CDPE), and the 28-item Goldberg's General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28), validated for our setting, will be used as measurement tools. Change in the average scores from the MBI emotional exhaustion scale will be compared between the intervention and control groups, measured as intention-to-treat, and the intervention will be considered effective if a minimum increase of 20% is achieved.

Discussion: Due to the deleterious consequences of burnout syndrome for people suffering from it and for the organization where they work, it is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of certain interventions for its prevention. Organizational measures are important for preventing burnout syndrome, but so is providing professionals with coping strategies, as this group intervention intends to do.","NO","Burnout Syndrome","BEHAVIORAL: Training","Maslach's burnout inventory (MBI), Worker classification regarding burnout syndrome will be performed according to the MBI, which includes 22 items to evaluate emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalization (DP), and personal fulfillment (PF), with scores ranging from 0 to 6 on the Likert scale.

"840","NCT04944225","Opioid Reduction Strategy South Western Ontario","NOT_YET_RECRUITING","Pain is a major risk factor for chronic postoperative pain. Adequate perioperative pain relief is an important metric for patient satisfaction and to achieve good recovery outcomes. Opioids remain the primary systemic pharmacotherapy for intraoperative and postoperative analgesia, particularly for moderate to severe pain. When used judiciously, opioids are effective in reducing suffering and helping patients cope with postoperative pain. However, there are challenges - a) side effects can result in harm, like respiratory depression; b) over-reliance on opioids can increase drug dependency; c) over-prescription can encourage addiction, overdose and death, leading to a human and financial burden from both, an individual, and public health standpoint. Over-prescription of opioids for acute pain is strongly linked to patient morbidity and mortality. For example, a new opioid prescription raises the risk of lethal or non-lethal overdose, as well as the conversion from opioid-naive to chronic user. Canadian Institute of Health Information (CIHI), and Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) data emphasize the public health need to reduce reliance on opioids: ""From January 2016 to June 2018, more than 9,000 Canadians died from apparent opioid related harms. In 2017, an average of 17 Canadians were hospitalized for opioid poisonings each day - an increase from 16 per day in 2016"". Prescription opioid use appears to be an early driver of the current crisis. Given the local and national severity of the opioid crisis, there is need for a pragmatic, timely, and scalable intervention to reduce reliance on opioids as we strive to improve healthcare for patients and alleviate the economic burden on the medical system. This proposal for a stepped-wedge randomized trial of a multi-faceted opioid-use reduction strategy addresses key drivers of the opioid crisis and has the potential to reduce patient exposure to opioids and, thereby, improve morbidity and mortality. Hospitals involved in this study will all eventually participate in an opioid reduction strategy that will limit the access and prescription of opioids to surgical patients and will incorporate various opioid reduction strategies at both a patient and hospital level.","NO","Opioid Use","OTHER: Opioid Reduction Strategy","total morphine milliequivalents (MME), The total morphone milliequivalents (MME) prescribed for each patient will be recorded by extracting this data from the ICES administrative healthcare database., Time of discharge up to 30 days postoperatively","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,100000,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: CROSSOVER|Masking: DOUBLE (PARTICIPANT, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: PREVENTION","2024-11-01","2025-01-01","2025-03-01","2021-06-29","","2024-02-28","","other"

"853","NCT05110924","RCT Treatment Versus Non Treatment of Low-risk BCCs in Elderly","RECRUITING","This study will be a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Patients with a minimum age of 75 years who consult at the dermatology department of the Ghent University Hospital and who are diagnosed with minimum one lesion suspicious for a low-risk basal cell carcinoma will be asked to participate in this study.

Rationale: Basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) represent 70% of all skin cancers. These tumors do not metastasize but are locally invasive if left untreated. There is a high incidence of BCC in elderly and clinicians frequently face important treatment dilemmas. The approach to BCC in elderly should be investigated thoroughly, since current data on health-related quality of life, complication risks and biological behavior of these tumors is absent, and most guidelines are based on studies in young patients.

Objective: The investigators will examine the possibility of not treating all BCCs by collecting data on the in vivo biological behavior of low-risk basal cell carcinomas in elderly patients with state-of-the-art imaging techniques. The investigators want to combine tumor characteristics with patient profiles, in order to estimate whether a chosen treatment will positively affect the patients' quality of life within a predetermined timeframe.

Study design: Randomized controlled trial (RCT) with study visits every 6 to 12 months for a total follow-up period of 36 months.

Study population: Patients consulting at the Department of Dermatology of the Ghent University Hospital with the minimum age of 75 years and a new diagnosis of (a) low-risk basal cell carcinoma(s).

Intervention: Evaluation of the impact on the quality of life and the complication risks in both study arms. In addition, survival data will be gathered in both study arms. In the non-treatment arm, there will be an evaluation of the biological behavior of these low-risk basal cell carcinomas using in vivo imaging devices.

Patients in the treatment arm will receive standard care. Patients in the non-treatment arm will be closely monitored: the tumor will be evaluated using non-invasive imaging devices. Patients will be asked to fill in a questionnaire concerning their HrQoL at consecutive time points. Also patient-reported side effects will be evaluated via a questionnaire. The investigators will compare standard treatment versus non-treatment (1:1 allocation) in a randomized controlled trial.

"865","NCT02628366","Major Outcomes With Personalized Dialysate TEMPerature","COMPLETED","People with failed kidneys need an artificial kidney machine (called dialysis) to remove toxins and extra fluid from the body. Most patients receive dialysis treatments at a hospital three times a week. During treatment, a patient's blood pressure may drop, causing dizziness and muscle cramping. Repeated drops in blood pressure can also injure the heart and brain. Over time, this can lead to heart attacks, strokes, and sometimes death due to cardiovascular causes. New research shows that cooling the temperature of the dialysis fluid (called dialysate) can reduce heart and brain injury. In most hospitals, all patients' dialysate temperature is set at 36.5 ºC (to match body temperature). In a study of 73 patients, we showed that reducing the dialysate temperature by 0.5 ºC below body temperature protected the heart and brain from injury \[1,2\]. We now want to test this simple, safe, low-cost intervention in a large study with \~7500 dialysis patients in Ontario.

"868","NCT04357730","Fibrinolytic Therapy to Treat ARDS in the Setting of COVID-19 Infection","COMPLETED","The global pandemic COVID-19 has overwhelmed the medical capacity to accommodate a large surge of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In the United States, the number of cases of COVID-19 ARDS is projected to exceed the number of available ventilators. Reports from China and Italy indicate that 22-64% of critically ill COVID-19 patients with ARDS will die. ARDS currently has no evidence-based treatments other than low tidal ventilation to limit mechanical stress on the lung and prone positioning. A new therapeutic approach capable of rapidly treating and attenuating ARDS secondary to COVID-19 is urgently needed.

The dominant pathologic feature of viral-induced ARDS is fibrin accumulation in the microvasculature and airspaces. Substantial preclinical work suggests antifibrinolytic therapy attenuates infection provoked ARDS. In 2001, a phase I trial 7 demonstrated the urokinase and streptokinase were effective in patients with terminal ARDS, markedly improving oxygen delivery and reducing an expected mortality in that specific patient cohort from 100% to 70%. A more contemporary approach to thrombolytic therapy is tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) due to its higher efficacy of clot lysis with comparable bleeding risk 8. We therefore propose a phase IIa clinical trial with two intravenous (IV) tPA treatment arms and a control arm to test the efficacy and safety of IV tPA in improving respiratory function and oxygenation, and consequently, successful extubation, duration of mechanical ventilation and survival.","YES","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome|Respiratory Failure|Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome","DRUG: Alteplase 50 MG [Activase]|DRUG: Alteplase 50 MG [Activase]","PaO2/FiO2 Change (Increase) From Pre-to-post Intervention, PaO2/FiO2 change (increase) from pre-to-post intervention at 48 hours post randomization.

"872","NCT05124639","Clinical Trial of a Group Self-management Support Program for Anxiety Disorders","NOT_YET_RECRUITING","Background. Self-management support is a complementary approach to treatment that aims to educate participants on the nature of anxiety and to improve their strategies to manage symptoms and well-being, thus presenting the potential to enhance recovery, improve outcomes, reduce recurrence rates and lower health care costs. There is limited evidence to support the effectiveness of group self-management support for anxiety disorders in community-based care.

Objectives. This study aims at examining the effectiveness of a virtual group self-management support program (SMS) for anxiety disorders as an add-on to treatment-as-usual (TAU) in community-based care settings. We will also assess the incremental cost/effectiveness ratio and the implementability of the intervention.

Methods. The trial is a multicentre pragmatic randomized controlled trial with a pre-treatment, post-treatment (4-month post-randomization), and follow-ups at 8, 12 and 24-months. Intervention. The experimental condition will consist of a 10-week SMS program for anxiety disorders in addition to TAU. The control condition will receive TAU without restrictions for anxiety disorders. Inclusion criteria will comprise being 18 years old or older, French-speaking, and meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) criteria for anxiety disorders: Panic Disorder, Agoraphobia, Social Anxiety Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Patients will be recruited within four regions in Quebec (Canada). Outcome measures: The primary outcome measure is the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). The secondary outcome measures include self-reported instruments for anxiety and depressive symptoms, recovery, self-management, quality of life, and service utilisation. Statistical analysis: Intention-to-treat analysis. A mixed effects regression model will be used to account for between and within-subject variations in the analysis of the longitudinal effects of the intervention.

Expected outcomes. The rigorous evaluation of the SMS intervention in the real world will provide information to decision makers, health care managers, clinicians and patients regarding the added value of group SMS for patients with anxiety disorders. Widespread implementation of this intervention could lead to more efficient mental health care services, to better long-term outcomes and to a significant reduction in the extensive social and economic burden of anxiety disorders.","NO","Panic Disorder|Agoraphobia|Social Anxiety Disorder|Generalized Anxiety Disorder","BEHAVIORAL: Group self-management support program for anxiety disorders","Change in Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Baseline and post-treatment (4-month post-randomization)","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,414,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE (INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT","2022-01","2023-06","2025-06","2021-11-18","","2021-12-16","","behavioral"

"881","NCT03510858","Randomized Controlled Trial on Colorectal Cancer Screening Among Quality Circles of Primary Care Physicians","UNKNOWN","In Switzerland, colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cause of death from cancer with 1600 persons dying from CRC each year. CRC screening can prevent most of these deaths. If screening begins at age 50, with either colonoscopy or faecal immunological test (FIT), the absolute risk of dying from CRC at age 80 can be cut in half. The choice between CRC screening methods can be seen as preference-sensitive condition. FIT can detect CRC at a similar rate as colonoscopy, but cannot detect as many polyps and advanced polyps as colonoscopies. Colonoscopy would seem the best choice for patients who want to reduce their risk of developing CRC or dying from CRC, but colonoscopy is an invasive procedure with rare but serious adverse effects. Patients who choose FIT do not need to prepare their bowels, or take a day off, but instead sample their own stool at home and mail the test to the laboratory. Offering the choice of test might also increase overall screening rates. Guidelines from the US Services Task Force (USPSTF) suggest shared decision making as a method for increasing adherence to screening and elicit patients' preferences for screening options.

Family physicians are recognized as the most trusted professional to discuss CRC screening in Switzerland. However, many primary care physicians (PCPs) appear to prefer colonoscopy over FIT, and the preferred method seems to vary widely between regions. Physician preferences and local medical culture likely determine these choices more than patient preference. It may be possible to reduce the number of PCPs who prescribe only one screening method by encouraging them to diagnose their patient's preferences for screening method. In Switzerland, training PCPs with educational support and decision aids increased the number who intend to prescribe both screening modalities in equal proportions (prescription of both colonoscopy and FIT in equal proportions).

To implement the intervention and determine how and if it changes PCP practice over time, the study will be conducted in quality circles (QCs) of PCPs. QCs are usually groups of 6 to 12 PCPs who meet regularly to reflect on their practice. QCs are a multifaceted, step-based intervention for quality improvement that has gained international traction because they can foster long-lasting behaviour change. In Switzerland, 80% of all PCPs attend QC regularly. Through QCs following the principles of Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) quality improvement cycles, PCPs can find ways to lower structural barriers to screening, assess their screening practices, and give each other feedback.

The study hypothesizes that providing PCPs with evidence summaries on CRC screening, decision aids for patients, and sample FIT tests will increase the number of patients screened for CRC, better balance the selection of screening methods (colonoscopy vs. FIT), increase the proportion of patients with whom PCPs discuss CRC testing, and increase the number of patients who make decision for or against CRC screening.

The outcomes in PCPs of QCs allocated to the intervention group will be compared to those in the control group. The outcomes will be measured through anonymous structured patient data collected on 40 consecutive patients by PCPs and questionnaires filled by PCPs.

To ensure that relevant outcomes important for future implementation and dissemination works are collected, the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework will be followed for structuring the data collection. The RE-AIM framework helps structure the collection of data on the characteristics of the participants invited who finally participate in the study (Reach), on the integration of the planned intervention in their work (Adoption), on the consistency of implementation of the planned intervention by study participants (Implementation), on the maintenance of the intervention effects over time (Maintenance), and finally, on the effectiveness of the intervention on the planned outcomes (Effectiveness). The RE-AIM criteria are useful for identifying the translatability and public health impact of this intervention, and for making clear to future stakeholders the internal and external validity of study results.

This study will test the benefits of a multilevel training program in participatory medicine designed to help PCPs in Switzerland to better diagnose patient preferences for screening and method of screening method (colonoscopy or FIT) through. If the program is successful it will increase the proportion of patients who can decide to undergo testing or not and with which method. This should increase in number of patients who are screened or intend to be screened for CRC, and thus reduce CRC deaths in the longer term.","NO","Colorectal Cancer","OTHER: Multilevel training intervention (intervention group)|OTHER: Multilevel training intervention (control group with crossover)","Proportion of patients which have been tested for CRC, PCPs will systematically collect data from 40 consecutive patients, aged 50 to 75 years, At 16 months after study begin","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,44,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: CROSSOVER|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: PREVENTION","2018-03-14","2020-10-30","2021-10-30","2018-04-27","","2020-03-24","Institute of Primary Health Care (BIHAM), University of Bern, Bern, 3012, Switzerland","other"

"891","NCT05163158","CENtral Blood Pressure Targeting: A Pragmatic RAndomized Pilot triaL in Advanced Chronic Kidney Disease","RECRUITING","Background: Emerging data favors aortic blood pressure (BP) over brachial cuff BP in predicting CV and renal complications, as this BP directly impacts the heart, brain and kidneys. In parallel, central BP measuring devices have been developed that are more accurate towards aortic BP and easy to use without training. In no other condition than advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) is BP control as important, since undertreatment is associated with adverse CV events and progression towards end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), while overtreatment similarly leads to adverse CV events and injurious falls but also acute kidney injury which can precipitate ESKD. To this day, standard BP management relies on brachial cuff BP, which is an imprecise surrogate marker of aortic BP, more so in the advanced CKD population. Considering that these patients have a high risk of CV morbidity and mortality and is a group where brachial BP may be the least reliable, it can be beneficial to manage hypertension in this population using central BP measurements. With the development of affordable and easy to use central BP devices, routine use of central BP in hypertension would now become a reality. However, the superiority of central BP to traditional brachial cuff BP in regard to clinical outcomes will first need to be demonstrated.

Objectives: To demonstrate that targeting central BP in advanced CKD patients as opposed to brachial cuff BP is feasible and results in lower arterial stiffness after 12 months of follow-up.

Methods: The CENTRAL-CKD trial is an investigator-initiated prospective parallel-group 1:1 randomized double-blinded multicenter pragmatic pilot trial. Patients with CKD stages 4 and 5 (n=116) will be randomized to either a central systolic BP target \< 130 mmHg (intervention) or brachial systolic BP target \< 130 mmHg (standard care). Central and brachial BP will be concomitantly measured, with treating physicians, patients and investigators blinded towards allocation. As this trial is of a pragmatic design, all other aspects of BP and CKD management, including anti-hypertensive treatment-related decisions, diastolic BP targets, and clinical and laboratory follow-ups will be at the discretion of the attending Nephrologist. The primary outcomes include feasibility of large-scale trial using prespecified criteria and aortic stiffness (carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity) at 12 months. Other cardiovascular, renal, quality of life and safety outcomes will be evaluated.

Importance: CENTRAL-CKD is designed as a pilot trial aimed at providing the framework and justification to proceed to a large-scale trial with adequate power to detect the impact of the proposed intervention on clinically important outcomes.","NO","Chronic Kidney Diseases|Hypertension","OTHER: Central vs brachial systolic blood pressure targeting","Feasibility: Consent rate, Proportion of participants who provide consent relative to the number approached for participation.

Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is the first line treatment for adult insomnia due to its comparable effect to medication in short term but is more sustainable in the long run. However, only a few sufferers have received CBT-I, due to limited accessibility, lack of trained sleep therapists, time costing and geographical limitations. To increase CBT-I accessibility, different formats of CBT-I have been proposed. Empirical evidence including ours consistently suggested that self-help digital CBT-I is effective in improving sleep while its augmentation with a guided approach could further enhance the treatment gain. Previous evidence has suggested that although self-help CBT-I could lead to positive outcomes, the drop out rate is quite high and maybe less effective for patients with comorbidity or high level of distress.

Thus, a stepped-care approach to CBT-I that utilizes online self help and therapist-guided modes of delivery might be a potential way to facilitate efficient dissemination of effective insomnia treatment resources. The effectiveness of the stepped care model will be evaluated in a real world setting using stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled design.

"901","NCT02647658","Targeted Interventions to Prevent Chronic Low Back Pain in High Risk Patients","COMPLETED","Low back pain (LBP) is a common problem among US adults. Initial episodes tend to be self-limited (""acute""), but some people can progress to a state of persistent pain. Often termed ""chronic"" LBP (cLBP), this condition can cause prolonged difficulty with most daily activities, including job performance. This study will compare two approaches for preventing patients with acute LBP (aLBP) from developing cLBP using a pragmatic, cluster randomized trial. The first approach is to provide PCPs with information regarding a patient's risk of transitioning from aLBP to cLBP and to encourage PCPs to treat patients according to accepted clinical guidelines. The second approach is to provide the same risk information and have PCPs team up with physical therapists to deliver psychologically-informed physical therapy (PIPT) for those patients determined to be at high risk for transitioning to cLBP. The 1,860 patients expected to be enrolled at five regional sites (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Boston, Massachusetts; Baltimore, Maryland; Charleston, South Carolina; and Salt Lake City, Utah) will start the study when their LBP is in an acute phase. The study's primary aims are to compare the proportions of cLBP and measures of functional ability between the two groups at 6 months. Secondary aims are to measure the referrals to physical therapists and specialists, opioid prescriptions, LBP-related x-rays or MRIs, surgeries, and other medical procedures during a 12-month follow-up period.","YES","Low Back Pain","BEHAVIORAL: Guideline Based Care plus Psychologically Informed Physical Therapy|BEHAVIORAL: Guideline Based Care (GBC)","Number of Patients Who Reported Transition From Acute to Chronic Low Back Pain (cLBP), Measured using a 2-item Chronic Low Back Pain (LBP) questionnaire.

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been the single most important treatment for slowing disease progression. ART adherence and HIV primary care are affected by a complex array of factors in the context of lives impacted by socioeconomic, psychological, and health challenges. Drugs and alcohol play a major role in non-adherence, engagement in care, and poor health outcomes among HIV-infected persons. While evidence is unequivocal that substance use treatment improves health outcomes, systems of care for the detection and treatment of substance abuse and dependence remain fragmented. Integrated approaches are key to the delivery of optimal care. Pragmatic or effectiveness trials can provide the best evidence about clinical practice to inform practitioners and policy makes about the most clinically and cost effective treatment to inform dissemination on a wider scale at the organizational and public health levels. The goal of this trial is to develop and test a comprehensive, integrated program to detect and reduce substance abuse and in turn, to improve ART adherence and HIV, substance use and associated health outcomes among HIV-infected patients.

"911","NCT05713916","Effect of a Targeted Notification and Clinical Support Pathway on Individuals With Left Ventricular Hypertrophy","ENROLLING_BY_INVITATION","The electronic health record contains vast amounts of cardiovascular data, including potential clues that an individual may have unrecognized cardiac conditions. One important example is the finding of thickened heart muscle -- known as left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) -- on echocardiograms (heart ultrasounds). If the underlying cause of LVH is untreated, individuals are at an increased risk of developing more severe pathology.

As the most common cause of LVH, hypertension and its downstream consequences account for more cardiovascular deaths than any other modifiable risk factor. Critically, many individuals have signs of cardiac damage from hypertension before it is diagnosed or treated. Despite this evidence, there are often gaps in healthcare delivery that contribute to substandard recognition and treatment. Thus, there is an urgent need to validate alternative cost-effective screening and intervention strategies.

Echocardiograms are ordered by many specialties and for numerous indications. Even when LVH is reported, the finding may be underappreciated and not prompt further evaluation. Whether data from prior echocardiograms can be harnessed to improve patient care through a centralized intervention is unknown.

Accordingly, the goal of this randomized pragmatic clinical trial is to study the impact of a centralized clinical support pathway on the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension and the recognition of LVH-associated diseases in individuals with evidence of thickened heart muscle on previously performed echocardiograms.","NO","Hypertrophy, Left Ventricular|Hypertension|Cardiomyopathies","OTHER: Intervention: Population Health Coordinator","Number of participants who are initiated on an antihypertensive medication, Collected from electronic health record data based on electronic prescribing data, 12 months from the start of follow-up","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,600,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT","2023-03-20","2024-06","2024-06","2023-02-06","","2023-03-23","Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, 02115, United States","other"

"914","NCT02491216","A Study on Effects of Acupressure Among the Frail Elderly in Residential Care Services for the Elderly","COMPLETED","Acupressure has been used for thousands of years in China. Through applying pressure on the specific acupoints based on Traditional Chinese Medicine theory, acupressure could promote relaxation and wellness, balance yin-yang and treat diseases.

The PI has been using acupressure to treat various diseases in the clinics of the School of Chinese Medicine, The University of Hong Kong. Acupressure has demonstrated significant efficacy in treating geriatric diseases, obstetric diseases, pediatric diseases, rheumatoid arthritis and various painful symptoms. When applying acupressure on the Head- Neck - Shoulder area, it could also help to improve insomnia, reduce pain, and regulate the mood of the patients.

""Frailty"" is a geriatric syndrome of growing importance in the medical field. Prevalence of frailty increases with age. As our life expectancy increase, there will be more elderly suffered from frailty in the later stage of their life. Although there is still a lack of universally accepted clinical definition for frailty, the syndrome is now commonly understood as decreased reserves in multiple systems, and lowered resilience to negative stress. Frailty could be initiated by single or multiple conditions including malnutrition, chronic diseases, lack of exercise, stress and physiological or social changes caused by aging. Its manifestation includes sarcopenia, anorexia, energy reduction, dysfunctional neuroendocrine system and a pro-inflammatory state. Frailty could affect the emotional state of the elderly, meanwhile, positive affect is protective against the functional and physical decline associated with frailty. There is limited treatment or medication for frailty. The investigators believe that acupressure could be a possible non invasive means to improve the general health conditions, including the emotional conditions of the frail elderly. In the past 2 years, the school of Chinese Medicine has been promoting acupressure as a health maintenance technique to the elderly, mostly frail elderly living in the community dwelling through seminars. It is in investigator's interest to run a prospective research to further understand the efficacy of acupressure in a wider range of frail elderly. The investigators would like to use a well-designed pragmatic randomized controlled trial (PRCT) to investigate if acupressure could help the frail elderly to improve their general quality of life","NO","Impaired","OTHER: Acupressure","Change of quality of life, questionnaire: Short Form 12 questions Health Survey version 2 (SF-12,v2), Version for Hong Kong Chinese will be used to measure the quality of life of the elderly pre-treatment and post treatment., Baseline, 12 weeks, 6th months","ALL","OLDER_ADULT",NA,65,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT","2015-08","2016-03","2016-03","2015-07-07","","2016-05-12","School of Chinese Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, 852, China","other"

Given blood pressure is normally higher during the day than it is overnight, blood pressure lowering medications are traditionally taken in the morning. However a randomized trial of 2156 Spanish hypertension patients published in 2010 (""MAPEC""), suggests a large (61%) reduction in mortality and cardiovascular morbidity if such medications are instead taken at bedtime. This degree of benefit far exceeds other established methods of cardiovascular risk reduction - and such a surprisingly large effect requires independent confirmation for practice to change. BedMed is a pragmatic randomized controlled trial facilitated by over 400 Canadian family physician members of the Pragmatic Trials Collaborative. During the conduct of this trial consenting hypertensive primary care patients, already established on one or more antihypertensive medications, will be randomized to either morning or bedtime antihypertensive use. Patient oriented trial outcomes evaluating both potential benefits and harms will be drawn largely from administrative health data that is routinely collected on all residents of Canada's publicly funded health care system.

"925","NCT04361435","Lung Recruitment Device for COVID-19","UNKNOWN","INTRODUCTION As there is no specific cure in the treatment of COVID-19 at this moment of the pandemic, supportive management including mechanical ventilation is the core management in an intensive care unit (ICU). It is a challenge to provide consistent care in this situation of high demand and potential staff shortage in ICU. Also, the investigators need to reduce unnecessary exposure of the providers to the virus. This study aims to examine the impact of care using a non-invasive oscillating device (NIOD) for chest physiotherapy in the care of mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19.

METHODS Objective: To explore if a NIOD performed by non-specialized personnel is not inferior to the standard Chest PhysioTherapy (CPT) in the care of COVID-19.

Design: A Pilot Multicenter Prospective Crossover Randomized Study. Setting: Two ICUs in Canadian Academic Hospitals (CHU Sainte Justine and Montreal General Hospital) Patients: All the mechanically ventilated patients admitted to the two ICUs, and CPT ordered by the responsible physician, with COVID-19 infection during the study period.

Procedure: The investigators will implement NIOD and CPT alternatingly for 3 hours apart over 3 hours. We will apply a pragmatic design, so that other procedures including hypertonic saline nebulization, Intermittent Positive Pressure Ventilation (IPPV), suctioning (e.g., oral or nasal), or changing the ventilator settings or modality can be provided at the direction of bedside intensivists in charge. The order of the procedures (i.e. NIOD or CPT) will be randomly allocated.

Measurements and Analyses: The primary outcome measure is the oxygenation level before and after the procedure (SpO2/FIO2 (SF) ratio). For the cases with Invasive ventilation and non-invasive ventilation, the investigators will also document expiratory tidal volume, vital signs, and any related complications such as vomiting, desaturations, or unexpected extubations. The investigators will collect the data before, 10 minutes after, and 30 minutes after the procedure.

Sample Size: The investigators estimate the necessary sample size as 25 for each arm (Total 50 cases), with a power of 0.90, alfa of 0.05, with the non-inferiority design.

FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS This randomized pilot study will be considered a running phase if the investigators can/should undertake the RCT which should follow without significant modification of the methods.","NO","COVID-19|Physiotherapy","PROCEDURE: Chest physiotherapy using a non-invasive oscillating device","SpO2/FIO2 Ratio, Difference before the procedure and 10 minutes from the end of the procedure, 10 minutes and 30 minutes from the end of the procedure","ALL","CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,50,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: CROSSOVER|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: SUPPORTIVE_CARE","2020-05-01","2020-07-31","2020-12-31","2020-04-24","","2020-04-28","","procedure"

The 1st objective of HiLo is to test the following primary and secondary hypotheses of HiLo:

Primary hypothesis: Compared to the current standard approach of targeting serum phosphate levels of \<5.5 mg/dl, less stringent control of serum phosphate to target levels of \>6.5 mg/dl will yield a reduction in the hierarchical composite outcome of time to all-cause mortality and all-cause hospitalization among patients with ESRD undergoing hemodialysis.

Secondary hypothesis: The main secondary hypotheses are that less stringent control of serum phosphate will reduce risk of all-cause mortality as well as the risk of all-cause hospitalization (individually) compared to the current standard approach of strict phosphate control (superiority analysis). In addition, the trial will test the secondary hypotheses that less stringent control of serum phosphate will result in increased serum albumin and protein catabolic rate (PCR), as markers of diet and nutrition.

The 2nd objective of HiLo is to conduct a second-generation pragmatic clinical trial in dialysis. In partnership with two dialysis provider organizations, demonstrate the following for a trial embedded in clinical care delivery:

1. Feasibility of obtaining informed consent using electronic devices (e-consent)
2. Use of a single IRB of record for hundreds of dialysis facilities

The COVID-19 pandemic showed the extreme vulnerability of persons with dementia (PWD) and their caregivers as they struggled to access support and resources due to the threat of COVID-19 infection; such impact was exacerbated in rural areas where caregivers are geographically isolated and disaster management resources are scarce. With the number of federally declared disasters increasing dramatically over the past 50 years, active public health efforts are needed to support caregivers in developing emergency caregiving plans usable in disasters such as pandemics and extreme weather emergencies. The long-term goal of this project is to enhance emergency preparedness and support networks of caregivers of PWD to increase their resilience and minimize distress by implementing an intervention program, Disaster PrepWise (DPW). In the DPW program, a trained Medical Reserve Corp (MRC) volunteer will provide step-by-step guidance to caregivers to jointly develop emergency preparedness plans and personal support networks. The objectives of this proposed study are to 1) test the impact of DPW on caregiver outcomes (i.e., resilience, stress) and perceptions that may mediate the association between DPW and outcomes (caregiver self-efficacy, preparedness, social support); and 2) evaluate implementation strategies in a real-world setting to optimize future dissemination. We will conduct a randomized control trial of 200 caregivers of persons with dementia involving two arms: DPW intervention group and an information-only control group (print information on disaster preparedness). Assessments will occur before randomization (baseline), and 3 and 6 months after the baseline. This study is innovative in its use of a highly personalized disaster preparedness program with built-in assistance to support caregivers; the support will be provided through an existing national-level public health infrastructure (MRC) that has a great potential to reach older adults and caregivers in rural areas.

"936","NCT03519425","A Pragmatic Randomised Study to Optimise Screening, Prevention and Care for Tuberculosis in Malawi","UNKNOWN","A pragmatic open, three-arm individually-randomised controlled trial and economic evaluation will be conducted in one primary health care centre in Blantyre, Malawi, where HIV and TB are major contributors to early mortality.

Participants will be adults with symptoms of tuberculosis (cough of any duration) attending the primary clinic with an acute care episode. We will exclude adults who have taken treatment for TB within the previous 6-months, who are taking isoniazid preventive therapy, who are not resident of Blantyre, or who plan to move out of Blantyre in the following 6-months.

Participants will be randomly allocated into one of three groups:

Group 1: Standard of care: Participants will be seen by facility health workers and receive clinician-directed screening for HIV and TB according to Malawi national guidelines.

Group 2: Optimised HIV testing and treatment linkage: Participants will be offered testing for HIV using rapid oral fluid kits by research assistants. Those with confirmed HIV infection will be linked to the HIV care clinic where facility healthworkers will screen for TB using standard sputum-based diagnostics.

Group 3: Optimised TB diagnosis, HIV screening and treatment linkage: Participants will receive a high-throughput and high-sensitivity TB screening intervention, in addition to the HIV testing intervention. This will comprise of an initial digital chest x-ray classified by the CAD4TB image-recognition software as either ""high probability of TB"", or ""low probability of TB"". Participants whose x-rays are suggestive of TB will receive confirmatory sputum testing with Xpert MTB/Rif Ultra cartridges, whilst participants whose x-rays have a low probability of TB will be referred to facility healthworkers for routine care.

All participants will be seen at the health facility at day 56, where they will be tested for HIV (if not on ART) and screened for TB.

The Primary Trial Outcome will compare between groups the time to tuberculosis treatment initiation by day 56. The trial is sufficiently powered to permit 3 pairwise comparisons between groups (i.e. Group 1 vs. 2; Group 2 vs. 3; and Group 1 vs. 3).

This three-arm pragmatic trial design allows us to efficiently answer two separate, important public health questions: firstly, by comparing Group 2 to Group 1, we should be able to determine whether HIV care should be prioritised for adults with TB symptoms. Additionally, by comparing Group 3 to Group 2, we will provide strong evidence for the effectiveness of an optimised and integrated HIV and TB diagnostic and treatment linkage approach.","NO","Tuberculosis|Hiv|Tuberculosis, Pulmonary","OTHER: Optimised HIV screening and linkage to care|OTHER: Optimised tuberculosis screening and linkage to care","Time to tuberculosis treatment initiation, The primary trial outcome will be time in days - from Day 0 up to but not including Day 56 - to tuberculosis treatment initiation, evaluated at Day 56 following randomization.

Accompany with decreasing educational hours in the classrooms and hospital, essential but minor components of primary healthcare such as ophthalmology and otolaryngology-head and neck surgery (ORL-HNS) is disproportionately under-represented in UME. Novel medical education stresses on enabling self-directory learning and increasing learning hours outside the classrooms. Accordingly, we hypothesize that innovations in educational technology can enhance the learning outcomes of ORL-HNS. This study is aimed to determine whether mobile technology in e-learning (M-TEL) is an effective tool for the instruction of ORL-HNS and to compare effects of different cognitive styles on learning outcomes of M-TEL with various modules of medical education. This is a randomized controlled trial. We will recruit 60 UME students without previous training in ORL-HNS to undergo the Group Embedded Figures Test to determine their cognitive styles such as field dependence or field-independence. After blinded randomization, students are instructed on two modules of emergent ORL-HNS disorders, using either a standard e-learning of text-figure Power Point show or an interactive multimedia module.

The aim of the research is to see whether Safe and Well Visits delivered by the Fire and Rescue Service will lead to a reduction in the number of falls and an improvement in health-related quality of life in older people. It will also look at the cost-effectiveness of the intervention and explore the acceptability of the Safe and Well Visits to older people and the Fire and Rescue Service.

The investigators will recruit 1156 participants, randomly divided into two equal groups. One group (the intervention group) will receive the Safe and Well Visit at the beginning of the study and the other group (the control group) will receive the visit at the end of the study.

The investigators will collect the number of falls people have using monthly falls calendars and follow up other outcomes by questionnaires at four, eight and 12 months post-randomisation. The investigators will also undertake interviews with some participants and with Fire and Rescue Service staff to explore experiences around the Safe and Well Visits.

"954","NCT02530216","Evaluating the Impact of Automated Evaluation of Gastrointestinal Symptoms (AEGIS) on Clinical Outcomes","COMPLETED","Healthcare delivery now mandates shorter visits with higher documentation requirements, undermining the patient-provider interaction. Electronic health records (EHRs) have the potential to improve outcomes and quality of care in this pressured environment, and are endorsed by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act as an important mechanism to support value-based healthcare. However, EHR systems were principally designed to support the transactional needs of administrators and billers, less so to nurture the relationship between patients and their providers. The purpose of this research is to identify ways to use EHRs to support clinical gastroenterologists and their patients while meeting the meaningful use requirements of the HITECH Act.

To improve clinic visit efficiency and meet criteria for meaningful use, investigators developed a patient-provider portal (P3) that systematically collects patient symptoms using a computer algorithm called Automated Evaluation of Gastrointestinal Symptoms (AEGIS). AEGIS utilizes computerized adaptive testing (CAT) to guide patients through questions drawn from a library of over 300 symptom attributes measuring the timing, severity, frequency, location, quality, and character of their GI symptoms, along with relevant comorbidities, family history, and alarm features. The system then automatically ""translates"" the patient report into a full narrative HPI available for use by GI providers in an EHR.

In a cross-sectional study in the American Journal of Gastroenterology comparing AEGIS versus physician-documented HPIs, investigators found that blinded physician reviewers perceived that AEGIS HPIs were of higher overall quality, better organized, and more succinct, comprehensible, complete and useful compared to HPIs written by physicians during usual care in academic GI clinics. In the current study, investigators aim to evaluate computer-generated HPIs prospectively on a wider scale in diverse academic and community-based settings. Moreover, investigators aim to test an enhanced AEGIS intervention that ties patient HPIs to an individualized ""education prescription"" which guides the patient through a library of multi-media educational materials on GI symptoms, conditions, and treatments.","NO","Abdominal Pain|Deglutition Disorders|Fecal Incontinence|Nausea|Diarrhea|Constipation|Gastroesophageal Reflux","OTHER: AEGIS (Automated Evaluation of Gastrointestinal Symptoms)","Prevalence of documented alarm symptoms, Prevalence of documented alarm symptoms (blood in the stool, unintentional weight loss, hematochezia, hematemesis) in the clinic note as documented by physicians., Completed and documented by the physician in the clinic note within 1 week of the initial clinic visit","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,610,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: NON_RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","2017-04-10","2018-02-07","2018-02-07","2015-08-20","","2018-05-01","Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, 90048, United States","other"

Fortunately, survival has improved in recent years thanks to its early detection and curative treatments such as mastectomy. However, this medical procedure is associated with a range of unwanted effects such as postoperative pain and anxiety. Some studies have reported that acupuncture could be an effective treatment to control these types of symptoms, although only few studies have been conducted on women undergoing mastectomy.

Methods: This is a pragmatic randomized controlled trial with blind assessors. The study will be conducted in the Breast Unit of Hospital Universitario Sagrado Corazon of Barcelona (Spain). A sample of 40 women will be recruited and randomized to receive acupuncture treatment in addition to standard care procedures, or standard care procedures alone. The main outcome, pain, will be assessed after the surgical intervention and 4, 10 and 30 days later using the numerical rating scale.

Vasculitis is rare, and there are a number of different types, which can affect both adults and children. We treat vasculitis with steroids and drugs aiming to damp down the activity of the immune system, but they often cause side effects. Some patients do not improve with this treatment, or cannot tolerate it and their vasculitis worsens; this is known as refractory vasculitis. Patients with refractory vasculitis are at high risk of health complications from the disease and its therapy and are in need of newer more effective treatments with fewer side effects.

Biologics are drugs which are designed to precisely target parts of the immune system and may have fewer side effects. Biologics have been used for several years to treat vasculitis, particularly anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis or AAV.

Consequently, surgeons differ on whether to initially treat with surgery or observation, with surgical rates in the first year of life varying from 15-50% across surgical practices. These variations are important to understand, as the decision for early surgery is not without risk. Prior studies suggest that infants treated surgically are at higher risk for readmission and reoperation. Early surgery also raises concerns about neurodevelopmental effects of anesthetic exposure.

To address this gap, the purpose of this pilot test is to develop a patient decision aid (PtDA) tool and pilot test its effect on parental understanding and engagement in the decision-making process at Children's Hospital Colorado. The proposed pilot is a necessary first step in preparation for a future multicenter hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial. This work will also be used to support future studies evaluating the impact of a PtDA on surgical variations and treatment outcomes in patients with UPJO and other complex congenital urologic anomalies.","NO","Ureteropelvic Junction Obstruction|Ureteropelvic Junction; Obstruction, Congenital","BEHAVIORAL: Parent Decision Aid","Differences in the SDM-Q9 scores between arms, The primary outcome will be differences in scores between the 9-item Shared Decision Making Questionnaire (SDM-Q9) survey scores between intervention and control arms.

Considering that most people with schizophrenia spectrum disorders continue smoking, it is urgent to consider alternative and more efficient interventions to reduce or prevent their morbidity and mortality. Switching to combustion-free technologies for nicotine delivery (I.e. e-cigarettes) could be a pragmatic and much less harmful alternative to tobacco smoking with the possibility of significant health gains. Emerging research is suggesting that ECs may be useful for smoking cessation and relapse prevention in people with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. In particular, a study conducted with JUUL e-cigarette with 5% nicotine strength showed that this product had sufficient nicotine delivery and product appeal to determine high success rates in heavy smokers with schizophrenia spectrum disorders.

In consideration of these preliminary findings, we hypothesized that switching smokers with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder diagnosis to JUUL e-cigarette with 5% nicotine strength could result in higher success rates compared to JUUL e-cigarette with 1.7% nicotine strength. Recent work indicates that nicotine PK of the JUUL e-cigarette with 5% nicotine strength (a device that utilizes a nicotine salt formulation) approximates the nicotine delivery of combustible cigarettes and that the 5% nicotine strength product is far more efficient in delivering nicotine compared to the sister product with 1.7% nicotine strength.

WA-related accidents and injuries may not only affect an individual patient's quality of life; they may also increase healthcare system resource use and caregiver burden. WA-related injuries may be preventable if WA are properly fit and sufficient training is provided to the WA user.

Smartphone applications (apps) are widely used technologies that have been used to improve health outcomes in populations of healthy and chronically ill individuals. We have developed an app that can be used to teach WA users how to properly fit and use their devices. This app is called Improving Canadians' Walking Aid skills, Learning, and Knowledge (ICanWALK©).

The development of the Walking Aids Skills Measurement Test (WASMT ©) allows for the objective measurement of how well an individual uses their walking aid. It is important to develop such a measurement in order to see whether interventions such as mobile applications change a walking aid user's ability to walk with their device.

In this respect, psychiatric mental health nurses have a crucial role to play. As they are the one who is in touch with the patients for 24 hours, psychiatric nurses can enhance the treatment process a lot through the application of a mindfulness-based relapse prevention program.

As drug abuse is such a devastating affliction, further knowledge about specific traits that may increase the chances of a successful recovery would be greatly beneficial to enhance treatment and decrease relapse rate. Accordingly, this study will be conducted to determine the effect of mindfulness-based relapse prevention program on readiness for change, and efficacy among clients with substance use disorder.

AIMS OF THE STUDY

The aim of this study is to:

Examine the effect of the Mindfulness-Based Relapse Prevention Program on readiness for change and self-efficacy among clients with substance use disorder during the rehabilitation phase.

"996","NCT01967342","Literacy-Adapted Psychosocial Treatments for Chronic Pain --- ""Learning About Mastering/My Pain""","COMPLETED","Chronic pain is a significant public health problem that affects over 116 million Americans, costs $600 billion annually, and is unequally borne by people in low-income brackets, especially ethnic minorities. Many individuals also have health literacy deficits (difficulty understanding their illness and difficulty navigating the health care system for treatment) putting them at a greater disadvantage. Treatment usually relies on expensive medical interventions that often have negative side-effects. Psychosocial treatments, like Pain Education and Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT), show promise, but are usually unavailable. Clinicians are poorly equipped to provide psychosocial treatments to patients with low health literacy. CBT has not been adapted and supported for use in individuals with low health literacy, and even educational materials are often poorly adapted for their needs.

To address this problem, the PI completed a small trial showing benefits from health literacy-adapted pain education and CBT groups for chronic pain in a population with low income and low health literacy. Patients in both treatments reported lower pain by the end of treatment, and the effects were maintained at one year. Patients in the CBT group also reported less depression. The current study uses a larger sample, and directly compares these psychosocial treatments to medical treatment-as-usual to seek better evidence for or against their widespread use in community settings.

Our research questions:

1. In people with chronic pain and low income and/or low literacy, does participating in a health-literacy-adapted psychosocial treatment improve their pain and interference in daily activities due to pain by the end of treatment when compared with a group receiving typical medical care, and are these effects maintained 6 months later?
2. Does participation in the CBT pain management group improve symptoms of depression better than a pain education group by the end of treatment, and are these effects maintained 6 months later?

In partnership with a federally qualified health center, we will enroll 294 patients with chronic pain. Main outcomes will be patient-reported pain intensity, pain interference, depression, and perceived change. From an earlier trial, we expect that our participants will be \~75% female and \~70% African American, and will have low literacy and low income (\~60% in the low 15% nationally on word reading, and 90% at or below the poverty threshold).","YES","Chronic Pain|Pain|Widespread Chronic Pain|Chronic Pain Syndrome|Chronic Pain Due to Injury","BEHAVIORAL: Pain Ed|BEHAVIORAL: CBT for Pain|OTHER: Usual Care","Brief Pain Inventory-Intensity (BPI-Intensity), Brief Pain Inventory-Intensity indicates level of pain intensity.

"999","NCT04135170","Antibiotic Loaded Bone Cement in Prevention of Periprosthetic Joint Infections in Primary Total Knee Arthroplasty","RECRUITING","Introduction: The current evidence on the efficacy of Antibiotic Loaded Bone Cement (ALBC) in reducing the risk of periprosthetic joint infections (PJI) after primary joint reconstruction is insufficient. In several European countries, the use of ALBC is routine practice unlike in the US where ALBC use is not approved in low-risk patients. It has been claimed that the antibiotic in ALBC increase the risk of aseptic loosening, risk of systemic toxicity, allergic reaction, and bacterial resistance. Therefore we designed a double-blinded (patients and data analysts) pragmatic multicenter register-based randomized controlled non-inferiority trial to investigate the effects of ALBC compared to plain bone cement in primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA).

Methods and analysis: A minimum of 9,172 patients undergoing full-cemented primary TKA will be recruited and equally randomized into the ALBC group and the plain bone cement group. This trial will be conducted in Norwegian hospitals that routinely perform cemented primary TKA. . The primary outcome will be risk of revision surgery due to PJI at 1-year of follow-up. Secondary outcomes will be:

* risk of revision due to any reason including aseptic loosening at 1-, 6-, 10-, and 20-years of follow-up;
* patient related outcome measures (PROMs) like function, pain, satisfaction, and health-related quality of life at 1-, 6-, and 10-years of follow-up;
* risk of changes in the microbial pattern and resistance profiles of organisms cultured in subsequent revisions at 1-, 6-, 10-, and 20-years of follow-up; and
* cost-effectiveness of routine ALBC vs plain bone cement use in primary TKA. We will use 1:1 randomization with random permuted blocks and stratify by participating hospitals to randomize patients to receive ALBC or plain bone cement. Inclusion, randomization, and follow-up will be through the Norwegian Arthroplasty Register.

Ethics and dissemination: The trial has been approved by the Western Norway Regional Committees on Medical and Health Research Ethics (REK-Vest) (reference number: 2019/751/REK vest) dated: 21.06.2019. The trial results will be reported following the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials Extension (CONSORT Extension) reporting guideline 2010 statement for non-inferiority trials. The trial results will be reported to the public through national and international scientific conferences, participating hospitals, patient organizations, and peer-reviewed journals.

Discussion: If we find that plain bone cement is non-inferior to the ALBC, it will challenge the routine use of ALBC in primary arthroplasty, due to ecological concerns and costs. However, if routine use of ALBC is associated with a reduced risk of PJI and with minor impact on bacterial resistance, PROMs, and costs, the well-established use of prophylactic ALBC in primary arthroplasty will be supported","NO","Osteoarthritis, Knee","COMBINATION_PRODUCT: ALBC vs plain bone cement","risk of revision due to PJI, 1-year follow-up","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT","PHASE2",9172,"OTHER_GOV","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE (PARTICIPANT, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: PREVENTION","2021-01-14","2023-12-31","2025-12-31","2019-10-22","","2021-01-19","Department of Orthopeadic Surgery, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway","combination_product"

"1002","NCT04998513","Medical Versus Surgical Treatment for Peritonsillar Abscesses","UNKNOWN","Peritonsillar abscesses are major infections around the tonsils. The abscess is a collection of pus that can cause a large amount of pain and discomfort, which can result in trouble swallowing and drinking. Peritonsillar abscesses must be treated because they can spread to other areas in the throat and neck, which can cause difficulty breathing, can even spread throughout the rest of the body.

Over the years, many different treatments have been used for peritonsillar abscesses. In the past, the entire tonsil was removed in the operating room while the patient was asleep. This surgery can cause a large amount of bleeding, and so now smaller surgeries are performed while the patient is awake. Small needles are put through the open mouth and into the abscess to drain it. As well, a small cut can be made to drain the infection. These last two treatments cause less problems than removing the whole tonsil, but there are still risks. The surgeries are uncomfortable for patients and they can cause anxiety and fear. There are also large blood vessels nearby that can be injured.

In the last few years, treatment of peritonsillar abscesses without surgery has been studied. Patients receive strong antibiotics and anti-inflammatories (known as steroids) and they may not need surgery. It is not yet known if this treatment works as well as surgery. In order to figure this out, research must look at both options compared against each other in a large study with many patients.

However, large research studies require a lot of planning, and so smaller studies are helpful to figure out if the larger study is even possible. The current study would be a small trial to plan for a larger study later on.

Patients will be randomly treated with either medications alone or with surgery. The main part of the study will look at issues with planning the future study, such as how long it takes to fill out forms, how many missing results there are at the end of the study, and how patients and doctors feel about taking part in the research study. The future large study will look at how well the treatment options reduce pain, how fast patients are able to swallow normally again, how often patients need to change treatments, and whether there are differences in quality of life with the treatment options. Because these things will be looked at in detail in the future large study, the investigators will also look at them during this small planning study, but the investigators will not be able to tell for certain which treatment is better until the large study is completed.

The results of this study are important for planning and performing the larger study, and they are important for getting future funding to do that study. Large studies are very expensive, and major funding organizations, such as the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, look for this early data when deciding who should get funding. The results of both this pilot study and the future larger study could be practice changing for how peritonsillar abscesses are treated, and will benefit both Nova Scotians and potentially the rest of world.","NO","Peritonsillar Abscess|Surgical Incision","DRUG: Medical Management Alone Arm|PROCEDURE: Surgical Arm","Recruitment rate, The number of eligible patients screened, regardless of participation, will be recorded and compared to the number of participating patients, 1 month|Retention rates, The number of patients completing the required follow-ups will be recorded, 1 month|Compliance, The number of completed NPS and analgesia diaries will be recorded, 1 month","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,24,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: OTHER","2022-01","2022-01","2022-01","2021-08-10","","2021-08-10","","drug"

This is known as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). VAP results in increased duration of mechanical ventilation, increased ICU and hospital stay, increased risk of death and increased health care costs. VAP occurs in 20% of patients and it is estimated that each case of VAP costs the health care system $10 to 15,000 Canadian. Because of its impact on patient outcomes and the health care system, VAP is regarded as an important patient safety issue and there is an urgent need for better prevention strategies.

Invasive mechanical ventilation requires the passage of an endotracheal tube (ETT) through the pharynx which is frequently colonized with bacterial pathogens and a bio-film rapidly forms on the ETT. VAP results either from aspiration of contaminated oropharyngeal secretions or from aspiration of bacteria from the bio-film. In this project, the efficacy of a novel ETT coated with an antibiotic compound that has been shown to reduce the formation of bio-film and pathogen colonization will be tested.

"1014","NCT04471532","Promotion and Support for Physical Activity Maintenance Post Total Hip Arthroplasty","COMPLETED","Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is considered an efficacious procedure for relieving pain and disability in patients with hip osteoarthritis. However, 6-12 months post-surgery physical activity level is unchanged compared to pre-surgery and still considerably lower than that of healthy peers. Increasing physical activity after THA may enhance the outcome of the THA because a graded relationship between physical activity level and functional performance has been documented. Six-8 months after THA physical function is only recovered to about 80% of that of healthy peers and older adults still seem to be at increased risk of frailty. Furthermore, these patients continue to impose higher healthcare costs than an age- and sex-matched reference population which potentially could be related to the functional status that is not completely regained. Finally, patients with hip osteoarthritis can have extensive comorbidity thus increasing physical activity after THA could be a simple and relatively inexpensive method for improving general health, which in turn may decrease healthcare costs.

The reasons for the lack of increase in physical activity despite increased capability after THA are unknown but it may be related to the sedentary behavior adopted by the patients prior to surgery and uncertainty. A systematic review has illuminated that patient-reported barriers to engaging in physical activity after THA are largely related to limited or inadequate information or education culminating in uncertainty about 'doing the right thing' for both the individual's recovery and the longevity of the joint replacement.

Few studies have investigated the effects of specific interventions to increase physical activity after THA. Promising results have been shown from physical activity sensors in combination with e.g. goal setting. None of these studies have addressed the patient-reported barriers to physical activity regarding uncertainty and limited education.

This trial aims to investigate the effect of adding a pedometer-driven, behavior change intervention to usual rehabilitation care 3 months after THA to increase physical activity compared to usual rehabilitation care alone (control). Outcomes are taken 3 (baseline), 6 (after the intervention period) and 12 months after THA (follow-up).

To optimize fluid balance, clinician has several options to consider carefully fluid administration and avoid fluid overload. More than a general restrictive approach, a pragmatic, individual tailored approach should be considered to optimize patients' hemodynamics during acute circulatory failure. Many advances in hemodynamic monitoring were described. Mini-fluid challenge appears to be a sensible method to use for bedside assessment to optimize fluid infusion. The next step for hemodynamic management in the ICU should be to test a hemodynamic goal-directed approach to better control fluid management and eventually improve patient's outcome. The main objective of the GOAL study is to evaluate a pragmatic optimization fluid management protocol tailored to each patient's hemodynamic status based on mini-fluid challenges.

SMBG testing is a resource intensive activity without firmly established patient benefits. While SMBG holds great promise for sparking favorable behavior change, the potential for no benefit or even patient harm must be acknowledged. Possible negative effects on patient quality of life must be more closely examined along with the speculative benefits of SMBG in non-insulin treated T2DM. Among studies examining this issue a general consensus is evolving; while SMBG may or may not be useful, its value can only be fully appreciated when the SMBG results are provided to patients in a useful manner. The overarching goal of this proposal is to assess the impact of three different SMBG testing approaches on patient-centered outcomes in patients with non-insulin treated T2DM within the real-world, clinic setting. In this pragmatic trial, 450 patients will be randomized to one of the following three SMBG testing regimens: 1) no SMBG testing, 2) once daily SMBG testing with standard patient feedback consisting of glucose values being immediately reported to the patient through the glucose meter, and 3) once daily SMBG testing with enhanced patient feedback consisting of glucose values being immediately reported to the patient plus automated, tailored feedback messaging. The first two arms represent common SMBG testing approaches. The third arm is an enhanced, patient-centered approach to SMBG testing.

We have successfully competed for this funding because we consistently produce high quality research and because we provide comprehensive team-based rehabilitation services to people with TBI and their families over the continuum of care that is associated with superior outcomes.

Lack of access to specialized TBI care is the most common need identified by individuals after they are hospitalized for TBI. The upper Midwest has some of the highest populations of rural dwellers, the elderly, and Native Americans, all of whom have a high risk for TBI and are more likely to have limited access to rehabilitation services after acute care. Explosive advances in communication technology have brought tele-medicine to the forefront of health care. The CONNECT trial will test the effectiveness of using modern technologies - such as phone consultation and other telehealth communication systems - to deliver specialized brain rehabilitation resources remotely to patients and providers in the upper Midwest. The groups targeted by the CONNECT trial are:

* Individuals recently hospitalized with TBI;
* Their families;
* Their local health care and other providers (primary care providers, psychologists, therapists, social service providers, job counselors).

The CONNECT trial is the first study of this scope - in 4 upper Midwest states (MN, IA, ND, and SD), 3 health systems (Mayo Clinic, Altru Health System in ND, Regional Health in SD), and 2 state Departments of Health (IA, MN) - using electronic technology to see if outcome can be improved by providing care with no face-to-face contact. The trial will study whether outcomes over three years are different in the group receiving this remotely provided model of care compared to a matched group that receives usual care in their communities.

"1038","NCT01913236","Tailored Implementation Intervention for Managing Depressed Elderly Patients in Primary Care","COMPLETED","Background The prevalence of depression is high and the elderly have an increased risk of developing a chronic course. International data suggest that depression in the elderly is under-recognised, the latency before clinicians provide a treatment plan is longer, and elderly patients with depression are not offered psychotherapy to the same degree as younger patients. Although recommendations for the treatment of elderly patients with depression exist, health care professionals adhere to these recommendations to a limited degree only. Investigators conducted a systematic review to identify recommendations for managing depression in the elderly and prioritised six recommendations. Investigators identified and prioritised determinants of practice related to implementation of these recommendations in primary care, and subsequently discussed and prioritised interventions to address the identified determinants. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of these tailored implementation interventions to implement six recommendations for the management of elderly patients with depression in primary care.

Methods/design Investigators will conduct a pragmatic cluster randomised trial comparing implementation of the six recommendations using tailored interventions with usual care. Investigators will randomize 80 municipalities into one of two groups: an intervention group, to which investigators will deliver tailored interventions to implement the six recommendations, and a control group, to which investigators will not deliver any intervention. Investigators will randomise municipalities rather than patients, individual clinicians or practices because we will deliver the intervention for the first three recommendations at the municipal level and investigators want to minimise the risk of contamination across practices for the other three recommendations. The primary outcome is the proportion of general practitioners' behaviours which are consistent with the recommendations.

Discussion This trial will investigate whether a tailored implementation approach is an effective strategy to improve collaborative care in the municipalities and health care professionals' practice towards elderly patients with depression in primary care. The effectiveness evaluation described in this protocol will be accompanied with a process evaluation exploring why and how the interventions were effective or ineffective.","NO","Depression","OTHER: Implementation intervention","General practitioners'adherence to treatment recommendations, 3-6 months after end of intervention","ALL","OLDER_ADULT",NA,80,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: ","2013-09","2015-02","2015-02","2013-08-01","","2016-08-03","Knowledge Centre for the Health Services, Oslo, 0130, Norway","other"

This trial might appear as a standardised RCT but there is a secondary element - an observational cohort the trial is embedded in. Trial A is the first (of possibly several) embedded pragmatic RCTs involving physiotherapy interventions that may identify therapies that will help improve outcomes for patients with axSpA.

The investigators are seeking to improve outcomes for these patients by comparing different physiotherapy interventions in subsequent trials with standard of care (SoC) physiotherapy. Trial A will compare routine care vs routine care plus MSM physiotherapy attempting to answer the primary research question if MSM on patients with axSpA improves spinal mobility.

In order to recruit patients and obtain outcomes for Trial A (n=70), the investigators will first recruit up to 300 axSpA patients receiving care at the Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases (RNHRD) in Bath into a cohort and observe their standard of care outcomes. This will allow to answer the cohort's research question of ""How does SoC physiotherapy in patients with axSpA reflect in data collected routinely on outcomes of the disease?"" Patients will be asked to consent to provide routine observational data on their wellbeing, be approached to take part in future trials of interventions which aim to improve outcomes for patients with axSpA, and not be approached unless they are offered the physiotherapy trial intervention.

"1041","NCT06069206","Effect of Direct-from-blood Bacterial Testing on Antibiotic Administration and Clinical Outcomes","RECRUITING","Bacterial blood stream infections are common and life-threatening. Bloodstream infections have historically been identified using blood cultures, which often take 24-72 hours to result and are imperfectly sensitive. Early administration of antimicrobial therapy is a fundamental component of the management of adults presenting to the hospital with a suspected bloodstream infection and/or sepsis.

But because blood cultures frequently take 24-72 hours to result, patients are typically treated with empiric, broad spectrum antibiotics. In a meta-analysis of sepsis studies, empirical antibiotic therapy was inappropriate for the organism that ultimately grew in culture in almost half of patients. Thus, patients are commonly exposed to unnecessary antibiotics without evidence of infection or with evidence of infection requiring narrow antibiotic selection. For example, current guidelines recommend the use of empiric intravenous vancomycin as coverage for a bloodstream infection caused by the bacterial pathogen methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Vancomycin requires careful monitoring due to its narrow therapeutic range and high risk of toxicity. Administration of vancomycin to patients who do not have MRSA can lead to avoidable adverse drug events and costs, as well as drive antimicrobial resistance.

There has been increasing interest in using rapid diagnostic tests that identify bacteria directly from whole blood samples without relying on growth in culture, referred to as ""direct-from-blood"" tests, to guide early therapeutic management of patients with suspected bloodstream infections in addition to standard blood cultures. One such FDA-approved, direct-from-blood test is the T2Bacteria® Panel. This panel's performance as a direct-from blood test for bacterial pathogens has been described in previous studies. A recent meta-analysis of largely observational studies reported a faster transition to targeted microbial therapy and de-escalation of empirical microbial therapy, as well as a shorter duration of intensive care unit stay and hospital stay for patients who received this direct-from-blood test.

We will conduct a pragmatic, randomized clinical trial examining the effect of using the T2Bacteria® Panel direct from-blood testing, compared to using blood cultures alone (standard of care), on antimicrobial receipt and clinical outcomes for adults presenting to the hospital with suspected infection and who have been initiated on empiric therapy with intravenous vancomycin.","NO","Bloodstream Infection|Sepsis Bacterial|MRSA Bacteremia|Vancomycin","OTHER: T2Bacteria® Panel (direct-from-blood testing)|OTHER: Usual Care","Time to last dose of intravenous vancomycin, The time between randomization and the start time for the last dose of intravenous vancomycin received by the patient within 14 days of randomization., Baseline to 14 days","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,500,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","2023-12-13","2024-10","2024-11","2023-10-05","","2024-02-08","Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, 37203, United States","other"

"1053","NCT04154917","Effectiveness of a Comprehensive Patient-centered Hospital Discharge Planning Intervention for Frail Older Adults","RECRUITING","A large number of frail older adults have difficulty performing activities of daily living and resuming former roles in the months following hospital discharge. This increases the risk of unplanned hospital readmissions and emergency visits after they return home. Comprehensive, patient-centered discharge planning has been reported to improve older adults' ability to perform activities of daily living and to reduce readmission rates after hospital discharge. However, to our knowledge, no evidence-based discharge protocol is routinely used in Canada with the frail population. An innovative discharge planning intervention called ""HOME"" was recently developed in Australia, which includes: 1) hospital based partnership with patient and family to establish goal setting and problem solving; 2) pre-discharge home assessment to address safety issues and problems with patient and family; 3) post-discharge home assessment and in-home training to address unmet needs; and 4) follow-up telephone calls to provide ongoing support to patient and family. A Canadian version of HOME has been developed. This will be followed by a large trial to investigate if this intervention increases functioning in daily life activities and decreases hospital and emergency readmissions for frail patients who are discharged home. Our proposed study is a preliminary and necessary step to identify problems that may arise during this large trial and address them proactively. If proven beneficial, the Canadian version of HOME would be an appropriate, applicable and acceptable intervention to improve patients' experiences and outcomes as well as change health practice surroundings discharge planning with frail older adults.","NO","Frail Older Adults","OTHER: HOME","Change from baseline Functional autonomy measure (SMAF) at 1 and 3 months after discharge, SMAF is a 29-item scale based on the WHO Classification of Disabilities.

"1057","NCT05545917","Advanced Practice Physiotherapy Care in Emergency Departments","NOT_YET_RECRUITING","Overcrowding in emergency departments (ED) is a major concern worldwide. Recent reports show that Canada has among the longest ED waiting times and limited access to care has been associated with poorer outcomes for many patients. Patients suffering from musculoskeletal disorders (MSKD) represent at least 25% of all ED visits and this number is expected to increase with the aging population. New collaborative models of care have been emerging in various settings, such as EDs, and physiotherapists (PT) have been identified as expert clinicians to care for patients with MSKD. These advanced practice physiotherapy (APP) models of care often allow for a more extended scope of practice for PTs in which they have direct access to patients without a physician referral, triage patients and sometimes prescribe medical imaging or medication. ED APP has emerged as a promising new ED model of care, but evidence of the efficacy and safety of such models is still limited. Only a few RCTs have been conducted and no studies have assessed the efficacy or cost-utility of physiotherapy models of care for patients with MSKD in Canadian EDs. Evaluation of the benefits of such models is highly context-dependent and systematic evaluation of these models is warranted to support further implementation in Canada.

The aim of this multicenter stepped-wedge cluster RCT and cost analysis is to compare the effectiveness of a direct access APP model of care compared to usual physician ED care for persons presenting to an ED with a MSKD, in terms of pain, function, health care resources utilization and costs.

Evidence-based development of new APP models of care in EDs could help improve access and quality of care for Canadians, thus relieving some of the pressure on our healthcare system by providing new innovative pathways of access to care for these patients.","NO","Musculoskeletal Diseases or Conditions|Emergency Department|Physiotherapy","OTHER: Experimental: APP care|OTHER: Control - Usual physician care","Brief Pain Inventory-Short form, Pain interference scale (BPI), The BPI is a self-administered questionnaire that includes seven items where the patient is asked to rate the impact of pain on various functional activities (pain interference scale) using a 10-point scale.

"1060","NCT05001217","Chinese Herbal Medicine Treatment as Adjunct Therapy for Parkinson's Disease","RECRUITING","Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a prevalent and debilitating condition. Conventional medications cannot control all symptoms and may inflict adverse effects. A survey reported that Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) is frequently sought. Existing CHM trials were contradictory and often of poor quality due to a lack of methodological rigor. A national clinical guideline was drafted in China with diagnostic criteria and treatment strategy of Chinese medicine (CM) patterns subgroups of PD. The suggested CHM was found to exhibit a neuroprotective effect in in vitro and in vivo studies. This trial aims to preliminarily assess the effect of CHM prescribed based on pattern differentiation on PD symptoms and patients' quality of life, and evaluate the feasibility of the trial design for a future large-scale trial.

Methods: This trial will be a pilot assessor- and data analyst blind, add-on, randomised, controlled, pragmatic clinical trial. 160 PD patients will be recruited and randomised into treatment or control groups in a 1:1 ratio. The trial will be conducted over 32 weeks. PD patients in the treatment group will be stratified into subgroups based on CM pattern and receive CHM accordingly in addition to conventional medication (ConM). The control group will receive ConM only. The primary outcome will be part II of the Movement Disorder Society Sponsored Revision of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS). Secondary outcomes will include part and total scores of MDS-UPDRS, domain and total scores of Non-motor symptom scale (NMSS). Adverse events will be monitored by monthly follow-ups and questionnaires. Mixed models will be used to analyse data by Jamovi and R.

Expected outcomes: The success of our trial will show that the pragmatic design with subgroup differentiation is feasible and can produce reliable results. It will also provide preliminary data of the effect of CHM on improving clinical outcomes and quality of PD patients. Data collected will be used to optimize the study design of the future large-scale clinical study.

"1062","NCT05463406","Procalcitonin and Lung Ultrasonography Guided Antibiotherapy in Emergency Departments","RECRUITING","Acute respiratory infections are a common reason of attendance at emergency departments. It is also the main reason of unnecessary antibiotic prescription. Antibiotics save lives, but can also directly harm patients by causing antibiotic-associated adverse events. Antibiotic use is directly related to resistance, which is one of the major threats of our century. In addition, some microorganisms live in and on the human body and promote many aspects of our health. Antibiotic treatment can disturb those microorganisms and therefore have long-lasting negative effects on our health.

Unfortunately, it is difficult to differentiate between viral infections, which usually heal spontaneously, and bacterial pneumonia, which needs antibiotics treatment. This is one of the reasons of this over-prescribing of antibiotics.

This project aims to reduce widespread use of antibiotics in the emergency department through a new diagnostic strategy of bacterial pneumonia. This strategy includes sequential use of well-known techniques: a clinical score, lung ultrasound and finally a biomarker, procalcitonin. The latter tends to be higher in bacterial infections. The combination of these different tests improves the diagnostic process and allows improved use of targeted antibiotics, with the ultimate goal of better patient management.

The study will compare the antibiotic prescription rate and the clinical course of patients managed using this new diagnostic approach with those managed as usual. The project will also evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of this strategy and its cost-effectiveness. These two aspects are essential for a wider implementation of this innovative diagnostic approach and decrease antibiotic resistance.","NO","Lower Respiratory Tract Infection","OTHER: The PLUS algorithm|OTHER: Usual care","Safety outcome, Proportion of patients with clinical failure (defined as a composite of any of the following: death or secondary ICU admission or secondary admission to hospital or hospital re-admission after index hospital discharge or complications due to the LRTI \[empyema, lung abscess\]), Day 28|Efficacy outcome, Proportion of patients prescribed an antibiotic in each intervention group between enrolment and day 28, Day 28","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,1530,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: SEQUENTIAL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: DIAGNOSTIC","2022-12-05","2025-03-15","2025-05-16","2022-07-19","","2024-03-13","Cantonal hospital of Baden, Baden, AG, 5404, Switzerland|University Hospital of Basel, Basel, BS, 4031, Switzerland|Kantonsspital Baselland, Liestal, BS, 4410, Switzerland|Luzerner Kantonsspital, Luzern, LU, 6000, Switzerland|Réseau Hospitalier Neuchâtelois, Neuchâtel, NE, 2000, Switzerland|Cantonal Hospital of St. Gallen, Saint Gallen, SG, 9007, Switzerland|Centre hospitalier universitaire vaudois (CHUV), Lausanne, VD, 1011, Switzerland|Hôpital Intercantonal de la Broye, Payerne, VD, 1530, Switzerland|Hôpital Riviera-Chablais, Rennaz, VD, 1847, Switzerland","other"

The worsening of symptoms is called exacerbations or flare-ups and can be debilitating and frightening, requiring additional treatment, often with azithromycin. This is an antibiotic medicine that also has anti-inflammatory properties. It is prescribed as long-term prevention to reduce the risk of flare-ups. Some people may be affected by side effects from azithromycin. Antibiotic resistance is another concern, especially when using azithromycin for prevention rather than to treat active infection.

It is currently unclear as to whether people should be advised to stop taking azithromycin once COPD has stabilised, or to stop it over the summer when fewer flare-ups happen. It is also not known if azithromycin is more effective in some people or more likely to cause side effects in others. Given these uncertainties, it is challenging to know how best to use azithromycin in managing COPD. Azithromycin is a valuable antibiotic, and should be prescribed where it has benefit but avoid unnecessary side effects and reduce the chances of bacteria becoming resistant to it.

The purpose of this trial is to be able to gain results to answer these questions, and to establish the effects of stopping azithromycin in people whose COPD has stabilised, who have been taking it for at least 3 months. This trial will compare continuing azithromycin with stopping it completely, or stopping over the summer only, continuing over the winter. The investigators will compare the effects of these three treatments in the trial on flare-ups, symptoms and quality of life, and find out what factors may affect how individual participants respond to them.","NO","Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease","DRUG: Azithromycin Pill|DRUG: Placebo","Time to first COPD exacerbation., Throughout the entire trial follow-up of 24 months","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT","PHASE4",1311,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT","2023-05","2025-09","2027-09","2023-03-16","","2023-03-16","","drug"

It can cause pain or aching, tingling or numbness in the affected hand. It may disturb sleep, or affect ability to do day to day things.

There have been several studies into the best treatment of patients with severe symptoms of CTS who are referred to a hospital for treatment. However, little is known about the best treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms who visit their GP but do not require hospital treatment.

The study will investigate whether a steroid injection is clinically effective in reducing symptoms and improving function in the short term (6 weeks) compared to a night splint in people consulting with mild to moderate CTS in primary care.We will study the effects of these 2 treatments over 6 weeks and at 6 months. Subject to further funding, the Study will also look at whether these 6 weeks of treatment are effective 1 year and 2 years later.

The study will take place in up to 50 GP practices and hospital clinics across the UK. Patients aged 18 and over who have been diagnosed with mild to moderate CTS which has been present for at least 6 weeks will be eligible for inclusion.

The steroid is a drug called ""DepoMedrone."" This drug is already widely used to treat CTS. In this study, one injection will be given. The splint is made of elastic and has an aluminium bar which sits on the palm of the hand. In this study, the splint will be worn at night for 6 weeks.

Part of the problem is poor adherence with self-monitoring and preventive drug regimes. This trial will test whether using mobile phone-based monitoring, as part of a structured care plan, improves clinical outcomes and confidence in people with poorly controlled asthma.

Adults and teenagers with poorly controlled asthma will be recruited and randomly assigned to one of two groups. Those in the mobile phone group will monitor their asthma daily using their mobile phone to record symptoms, medication and lung function. Instantaneous feedback to their phone will provide a visual indication of asthma control and prompts about therapy. The patient and their clinician will have web-based access to all readings. People in the control group will use traditional paper-based monitoring. Under the care of their asthma nurse, both groups will be treated according to the step-wise approach of the BTS/SIGN asthma guideline in order to gain control.

We will use the validated Asthma Control Questionnaire to measure control at baseline, three and six months, and compare improvement in the two groups. We will also assess how confident people feel in controlling their asthma, using a validated measure of self-efficacy, attitudes and knowledge.

It is reported that patients prefer to restate or rephrase their understanding in a care setting, instead of a directive/didactic approach where the clinician provides 'one-way' information. In fact, directive persuasion is thought to lead to resistance to change and is counter-effective.

New approaches such as open ended communication, interview style and collaborative approach is found to engage patients better in their own care and elicit patient's own intrinsic motivations for making changes. One way to do this is to

1. invite patient to share their thoughts or concerns then
2. clarify patient's understanding

(3a) affirm patient's correct understanding or (3b) address misconceptions with permission.

"1088","NCT00565942","Exploring Integrative Medicine in Swedish Primary Care","COMPLETED","Research over the last years have reported an increased popularity of complementary therapies (CTs) and an integration of CTs into mainstream medical settings, health care organizations and insurance plans. These trends may present both new challenges and new opportunities for health care provision. In Sweden and elsewhere, major challenges include the great variety and quality of CT provision within health care and a lack of national and international recommendations of how integrations of CTs with conventional care should be modelled, i.e. lack of conceptual models for delivering integrative medicine (IM). This may partly be a result of a scarce evidence base in support of IM provision within public health care services, e.g. lack of IM compared to usual care in randomised clinical trials. It remains largely unknown whether comprehensive models of IM are clinically or cost effectively different from conventional care provision.

Back and neck pain are costly, conventionally managed in primary care and two of the most common conditions treated by CTs. We have developed a comprehensive collaborative consensus model for IM adapted to Swedish primary care. The aim of this pilot study was to explore the feasibility of a pragmatic randomised clinical trial to investigate the effectiveness of the IM model versus conventional primary care in the management of patients with non-specific back/neck pain.","NO","Back or Neck Pain of at Least 2 Weeks Duration","PROCEDURE: Integrative care|PROCEDURE: Usual care","Days with pain, Number of days with pain over the last two weeks (0-14 days), Change from baseline to follow-up after 16 weeks|Physical functioning, SF-36 domain 0-100 (higher score better), Change from baseline to follow-up after 16 weeks|Role physical, SF-36 domain 0-100 (higher score better), Change from baseline to follow-up after 16 weeks|Bodily pain, SF-36 domain 0-100 (higher score better), Change from baseline to follow-up after 16 weeks|General health, SF-36 domain 0-100 (higher score better), Change from baseline to follow-up after 16 weeks|Vitality, SF-36 domain 0-100 (higher score better), Change from baseline to follow-up after 16 weeks|Social functioning, SF-36 domain 0-100 (higher score better), Change from baseline to follow-up after 16 weeks|Role emotional, SF-36 domain 0-100 (higher score better), Change from baseline to follow-up after 16 weeks|Mental health, SF-36 domain 0-100 (higher score better), Change from baseline to follow-up after 16 weeks|Disability, Numerical rating scale 0-10 (higher score worse), Change from baseline to follow-up after 16 weeks|Stress, Numerical rating scale 0-10 (higher score worse), Change from baseline to follow-up after 16 weeks|Well-being, Numerical rating scale 0-10 (higher score better), Change from baseline to follow-up after 16 weeks|Use of prescription analgesics, Use of prescription analgesics during the last two weeks (yes/no), Change from baseline to follow-up after 16 weeks|Use of non-prescription analgesics, Use of non-prescription analgesics during the last two weeks (yes/no), Change from baseline to follow-up after 16 weeks|Use of conventional care, Use of conventional care during the last two weeks (yes/no), Change from baseline to follow-up after 16 weeks|Use of complementary care, Use of complementary care during the last two weeks (yes/no), Change from baseline to follow-up after 16 weeks","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,80,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT","2004-09","2007-11","2007-11","2007-11-30","","2020-10-29","Karolinska Institutet, Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society, Division of Nursing, Huddinge, 141 83, Sweden","procedure"

"1091","NCT04796415","DEMA-Pro Intervention for Seniors With Subjective Cognitive Decline and Living at Home","COMPLETED","More than 4.4 million patients receive home health services following discharge from the hospital or rehabilitation facility. A substantial number (70%) are older adults with subjective cognitive decline (SCD), an early clinical sign of Alzheimer's disease and related dementia. SCD is associated with diminished activity performance, poor quality-of-life and other adverse health outcomes (e.g., depressive symptoms). Home health patients with SCD often require more time, structure, and guidance to complete tasks and adjust to new skills and environments. Support is especially important during this high-risk period of transition between care settings. We propose a new home health care delivery model in partnership with Kindred at Home (KAH), a division of Humana that encompasses 400 programs across 40 states. DEMA-Pro builds on five preliminary studies that demonstrated high feasibility, acceptability, and positive preliminary effects on health outcomes (physical function, mood, and QoL). DEMA-Pro will be refined for delivery by home health services staff to patients with SCD and their informal caregivers. The overall goal of this research will be to conduct a pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) of DEMA-Pro to improve outcomes in-home health service patients with SCD. In the current R61 pilot phase, we will establish the trial's organizational structure and processes and pilot test DEMA-Pro in 4 home health services sites. In a subsequent trial, we plan to conduct a full pragmatic RCT in a group of Kindred KAH sites comparing DEMA-Pro to usual care. Consistent with the spirit of a pragmatic trial, we will use existing data sources including electronic Medicare OASIS (Outcome and Assessment Information Set) data, and QoL to characterize the cohort and measure outcomes. Thus, the focus of the pilot phase will be to ensure all processes are in place to conduct the subsequent RCT.

Aim 1. Establish the organizational infrastructure and programmatic processes needed to conduct a pragmatic cluster-randomized control trial of the DEMA-Pro intervention versus usual care. A Steering Committee will lead the project and coordinate the activities of 3 Work Groups: Regulatory and Operations; DEMA-Pro Intervention Protocol; and Data Management and Analysis.

AIM 2. Develop and pilot test the data collection tool with consultant and advisory panel input. Interviews of NH administrators and staff who participate in the pilot testing of CHATO and a process evaluation will be used to identify and develop supports for implementation and sustainability in preparation for future CHATO testing.

Design and Outcomes The R61 will prepare for the R01 pragmatic trial by establishing feasibility of online modules and preliminary efficacy of CHATO with NH staff. The research design is a randomized clinical trial. One NH will provide initial feasibility testing. Any modifications to the modules will be made. Then six nursing homes (estimated N=150 staff) will be randomly assigned to intervention or wait-list control groups. The primary outcome will be knowledge gain for staff completing CHATO training. Additional outcomes include resident quality measures related to behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) on both resident and facility levels and facility level data related to inappropriate use of psychotropic medications to control BPSD. Implementation strategies will be assessed by survey and leadership interviews completed by an external evaluator.

"1099","NCT04155606","Comprehensive Aneurysm Management Trial","RECRUITING","The uncertainty regarding the management of Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysms (UIAs) has not progressed in the last 30 years. The fundamental ethical basis for this study is that physicians should only offer a risky preventive treatment when it has been shown to be beneficial. Before that, such treatment should be offered as an RCT. The CAM trial offers a comprehensive framework, so that all patients confronted with the clinical dilemma can be offered participation.

The prinicpal questions to be addressed are :

1. do patients with UIAs, considered for curative treatments, have a better long-term clinical outcome with active treatment or conservative management?
2. when patients are considered ineligible for conservative management, and surgical and endovascular management are both judged reasonable, do patients with UIAs have a better long-term clinical outcome with surgical or endovascular management? The primary hypothesis for patients allocated to at least 2 options, one of which is conservative management is: the 10 year combined neurological morbidity and mortality (mRS\>2) will be reduced from 24% to 16% (beta 80%; alpha 0.048; sample size 961 patients (836 plus 15% losses to FU and cross-overs) with active treatment.

This study is designed as a pragmatic, comprehensive way to address the unruptured aneurysm clinical dilemma, combining large simple RCTs whenever patients are judged eligible for more than one management option, or otherwise a registry of each option. All patients with one or more UIAs will be eligible for participation in either a registry or one of the trials. Patients will be followed for 10 years according to a standard of car follow-up schedule.

The primary outcome is survival without neurological dependency (mRS\<3) at 10 years.

The secondary outcomes are:

1. the incidence of SAH during follow-up and related morbidity and mortality;
2. the morbidity and mortality related to endovascular or surgical treatment of the UIA at one year;
3. overall mortality at 1, 5 and 10 years;
4. overall morbidity (mRS\>2) at 1, 5 and 10 years;

These interventions are a) communicating an individual's phenotypic risk of CVD, b) a digital psychoeducation application (Heart Age-HOPE-CVD app) that supports health-promoting behavioural change, and c) communicating an individual's genetic risk of CVD. Our study hypothesis is that the exposure of these three interventions will have additive effects on the primary and secondary objectives.

The primary objective of our study is to evaluate the impact of each intervention arm compared to usual care (Arm 1) on the risk for CVD, using change in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) measurements as the outcome measure. The secondary objective is to evaluate the impact of each intervention arm compared to usual care (Arm 1) on the following: (a) individual CVD risk factors (i.e. blood pressure, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, body mass index, smoking status, fasting blood glucose or glycated haemoglobin, diagnosis of diabetes, triglycerides level), (b) risk for CVD (i.e., estimated using the Framingham Risk Score), (c) health-related quality of life and well-being, and (d) practice of health-promoting behaviours.

The Heart Age-HOPE-CVD app is a 6-month interventional programme. Hence, the effects of the interventions will be evaluated after a 6-month period. Patients will be recruited by general practitioners (GPs) at primary care clinics around Singapore. After obtaining informed consent at baseline, patients' data will be collected at four time points: baseline, mid-intervention at week 6, post-intervention health screening at week 24 and post-intervention at week 26.

Aim 2: Conduct a pilot pragmatic patient-randomized control trial (RCT) to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention linking eligible patients to our childcare facility compared to standard of care on retention in care, defined as show-rate for the initial visit in the gynecology dysplasia clinic. The intervention will consist of 1) patient navigation to our childcare facility prior to the initial visit in the gynecology dysplasia clinic and 2) placement of an electronic medical record (EMR) referral to our childcare facility.

Hypothesis: The study team hypothesizes that women receiving the intervention will have increased retention in care compared to women randomized to standard of care among women with abnormal cervical cancer screening referred to gynecology for diagnostic work-up.

These two aims will demonstrate the significance of childcare as a social determinant of health in the cervical cancer screening and diagnostic continuum by assessing the burden of unmet childcare needs among women with cervical dysplasia and measuring the effect of health system-integrated childcare as an intervention for unmet childcare needs on retention in care and subsequent completion of diagnostic work-up among women with cervical dysplasia. This study will rigorously provide the first evidence illustrating the effect of health systems' investment in addressing unmet childcare needs on preventive care like cervical cancer screening.

Precision medicine approach starts with the completion of many tests and then the study doctor uses the test results to carefully prepare a treatment plan that is best for the individual person to help treat many of the underlying causes of mild cognitive impairment or early-stage dementia.

The main question the study aims to answer is:

• Does the precision medicine approach improve memory (cognitive function) better than the current standard-of-care treatment in people with mild cognitive impairment or early-stage dementia during a 9-month treatment period? This is a randomized clinical trial which means that a group of people that meet the study requirements will be assigned at random or by chance (like toss of a coin) to receive either the precision medicine treatment or the current gold standard (standard-of-care). People assigned to the precision medicine group will receive precision medicine for 9-months while those assigned to the standard-of-care group will follow that approach for 9-months, followed by an opportunity to receive up to six months of precision medicine, if desired.

Participants will be asked to:

* Have their blood drawn for extensive lab testing and collect urine and stool samples as well
* Carefully follow instructions received from their study doctor and study team
* Make lifestyle changes as prescribed by the study doctor and study team based on your precision medicine program
* Take supplements and medications prescribed by the study doctor.

The investigators hypothesize that the NYUCI will be more effective than REACH OUT in reducing caregiver depressive symptoms and burden among Hispanics because of its focus on family-centered counseling, which is posited to be more important among Hispanic caregivers because of a cultural emphasis among Hispanics on family interactions in interventions. In order to answer the primary question, the investigators will conduct a pragmatic randomized trial comparing the NYUCI vs. REACH OUT in 200 Hispanic caregivers of persons with dementia in the community of Northern Manhattan. The total time of the intervention will be 6 months.

Our research question is which intervention, NYUCI or REACH OUT, is better in Hispanic relative (any relative) caregivers of persons with dementia. Our objective is to obtain effectiveness information that will help caregivers and health providers to make decisions about which intervention to choose. Our primary aim is to compare the effectiveness of the implementation of the NYUCI and REACH OUT in reducing depressive symptoms and burden. Our exploratory aims are to examine and compare the predictors of effectiveness of the NYUCI and REACH OUT and to examine additional outcomes such as caregiver stress and physical health, and outcomes related to the person with dementia. METHODS. We will conduct a pragmatic randomized trial of 200 relative caregivers of persons with dementia. Participants will be randomized to the NYUCI or REACH OUT. The total duration of the intervention will be 6 months, with assessments at baseline and follow-up. All interventions and questionnaires will be conducted in both English and Spanish.

"1126","NCT04611854","Internet-delivered Therapy for Alcohol Misuse: Investigating Patient Preference for Self-guided or Guided Treatment","COMPLETED","Internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy (ICBT) shows promise as a method of treating alcohol misuse. In this form of treatment, patients complete online lessons over several weeks that assist patients in developing skills to address alcohol misuse. ICBT can be offered to patients in a self-guided format or with guidance. Self-guided ICBT allows users to complete lessons by themselves without any contact with a guide. Guided ICBT involves having support from a guide in the form of emails, online messages and/or brief telephone calls. In some studies, guided-ICBT has shown greater reductions in alcohol consumption than self-guided ICBT. To date, there has been limited research on patient preferences for these varying levels of support when ICBT is offered as part of routine health care. This represents an important research direction as there is some past research showing that patients' treatment preferences can affect study enrollment, attrition, adherence, satisfaction, and outcomes.

This study will investigate patient preferences for self-guided ICBT versus guided-ICBT and compare enrollment, attrition, adherence, and outcomes of the two approaches when patients select their treatment preferences. The study will also explore the extent to which preferences are related to patient background variables (e.g., duration, severity of problems, treatment goals in terms of patients wanting to cut-down on alcohol use versus to abstain from alcohol use). Furthermore, this study seeks to identify how ratings of effort and helpfulness throughout treatment vary depending on whether patients select self-guided versus guided ICBT. This study represents a pragmatic observational trial conducted in routine care and aims to increase understanding of how to implement ICBT within routine care.","NO","Alcohol Use Disorder","BEHAVIORAL: Guidance|BEHAVIORAL: ICBT for alcohol misuse","Drinks in preceding week as measured by Timeline Followback (TLFB), Change in preceding week alcohol consumption in terms of the total number of standard drinks consumed on each day during the previous 7 days., Screening, Pre-treatment, 4 weeks (mid-treatment), 8 weeks (post-treatment), 3 months after treatment|Heavy drinking days preceding week as measured by Timeline Followback (TLFB), Change in preceding week alcohol consumption in terms of the total number of heavy drinking days during the previous 7 days., Screening, Pre-treatment, 4 weeks (mid-treatment), 8 weeks (post-treatment), 3 months after treatment","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,80,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: NON_RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT","2020-11-01","2022-08-19","2022-08-19","2020-11-02","","2023-12-04","Online Therapy Unit, University of Regina, Regina, Saskatchewan, S4S 0A2, Canada","behavioral"

"1128","NCT06069154","Ultrasound-Guided Percutaneous Cryoneurolysis to Treat Pain Following Thoracic Trauma","ENROLLING_BY_INVITATION","Thoracic trauma frequently involve rib fractures which can be very painful for 2-3 months. Unfortunately, pain is not simply a ""symptom"" of the injuries, but a significant cause of additional medical problems: pain causes people to breath and cough less deeply/often which increases the risk of collapsing little parts of the lung. These collapsed areas often lead to complications which can increase the risk of death. In addition, the higher the amount of pain in the weeks following the fracture, the higher the risk of developing persistent, chronic pain that can last indefinitely. So, providing excellent pain control is very important for a variety of reasons. Various nerve blocks can greatly decrease pain, but even the longest acting are measured in hours or days, and not the weeks and months for which rib fracture pain can last. Therefore, opioids-""narcotics""-are the most common pain control method provided to patients; but they frequently do not provide enough pain control, have undesirable side effects like nausea and vomiting, and are sometimes misused which can lead to addiction or overdose.

A prolonged nerve block lasting multiple months from a single treatment may be provided by freezing the nerve using a process called ""cryoneurolysis"". With cryoneurolysis and ultrasound machines, a very small ""probe"" may be placed through anesthetized skin and guided to the target nerve to allow freezing. The procedure takes about 5 minutes for each nerve, involves little discomfort, has no side effects, and cannot be misused or addictive. After 2-3 months, the nerve returns to normal functioning. The investigators have completed a small study suggesting that a single cryoneurolysis treatment provides potent short- and long-term pain relief following thoracic trauma with rib fractures. The ultimate objective of the proposed research is to determine if percutaneous cryoneurolysis is an effective non-opioid, single-application treatment for pain following traumatic rib fracture.

The current project is a pragmatic, multicenter, randomized, triple-masked (investigators, participants, statisticians), sham/placebo-controlled, parallel-arm, human-subjects, post-market clinical trial to determine if cryoneurolysis is an effective non-opioid treatment for pain following traumatic rib fractures.","NO","Rib Fracture|Rib Fracture Multiple","DEVICE: Cryoneurolysis|PROCEDURE: Local anesthetic peripheral nerve block|DEVICE: Sham Cryoneurolysis|PROCEDURE: Sham peripheral nerve block","Opioid consumption during first 2 post-intervention months, Cumulative opioid dose measured in oral oxycodone equivalents following intervention for 9 specific 24-hour time points over the first 2 months following surgery.

"1134","NCT04098354","Telemonitoring of Hypertensive Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease","RECRUITING","Background:

Hypertension, together with poorly controlled blood pressure (BP) are known risk factors for kidney disease and progression to kidney failure as well as increased cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality. Several studies in patients without kidney disease have demonstrated the efficacy of home BP telemonitoring (HBPT) for BP control.

Objective:

The primary aim of this study is to assess the mean difference in systolic BP (SBP) at 12 months, from baseline in remote dwelling patients with hypertension and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in Northern Alberta, Canada, comparing HBPT + usual care versus HBPT + a case manager. Other secondary objectives, including cost-effectiveness and acceptability of HBPT as well as occurrence of adverse events will also be assessed.

Methods

Design:

This study is designed as a pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT) of HBPT plus clinical case management compared to HBPT with usual care.

Setting:

Peace River region in Northern Alberta Region, Canada.

Patients:

Primary care patients with CKD and hypertension.

Measurements:

Eligible patients will be randomized 1:1 to HBPT + BP case management versus HBPT + usual care. In the intervention arm, BP will be measured 4 times daily for 1 week, with medications titrated up or down by the study case manager until guideline targets (systolic BP \[SBP\]: \<130mmHg) are achieved. Once BP is controlled, (i.e., to guideline-concordant targets), this 1-week protocol will be repeated every 3 months for 1 year. Patients in the control arm will also follow the same BP measurement protocol, however, there will be no interactions with the case manager; they will share their BP readings with their primary care physicians or nurse practitioners at scheduled visits.

Limitations:

Potential limitations of this study include the relatively short duration of follow-up, possible technological pitfalls, and need for patients to own a smartphone and have access to the internet to participate.

Conclusions:

As this study will focus on a high-risk population that has been characterized by a large care gap, it will generate important evidence that would allow targeted and effective population-level strategies to be implemented to improve health outcomes for high-risk hypertensive CKD patients in Canada's remote communities.","NO","Chronic Kidney Diseases","DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: home BP telemonitoring system .","Effectiveness of telemonitoring and protocol-based case management versus usual care:, The primary outcome will be the mean difference (MD) in home SBP at 12 months, from baseline values., Upto 12 months","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,146,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: DIAGNOSTIC","2022-04-15","2025-07-31","2025-07-31","2019-09-23","","2024-03-12","University of Alberta, Edmonton, Albert, T6G 2C8, Canada","diagnostic_test"

Yet, in spite of the proven benefits of integration of palliative care in oncology, it has been well established that patients with hematologic malignancies and those undergoing cellular therapy (hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy) do not routinely receive palliative care. Most of the published research on the early integration of palliative care in oncology describes studies that have involved patients with solid tumours. To date, only one randomized trial examining the impact of integrated palliative care among patients undergoing HSCT has been published and there have been no studies examining the impact of integrated palliative care for patients undergoing CAR T-cell therapy. The American Society of Clinical Oncology recommends early palliative care for patients with advanced cancers or for those with high symptom burden. Patients with blood cancers experience high symptom burden and in the last 30 days of life, compared to patients with solid tumours, patients with blood cancers are more likely to die in hospital, have more intensive care unit admissions, have prolonged hospitalizations (\>14 days), and pass away in an acute care facility. There is an urgent need to proactively address suffering throughout cellular therapy trajectories, even before treatment starts, so that patients and caregivers are not inevitably waiting for symptoms to arise before they can be addressed and to optimize quality of life for patients undergoing transplant as well as their family caregivers.

Two widely endorsed approaches are consistently effective for treating AEPs: family therapy and CBT. Importantly, stronger fidelity to core EBIs of these approaches predicts better outcomes in research and community settings. Yet these EBIs are not widely implemented with fidelity. To help close this quality gap in adolescent services, investigators will develop an online intervention to strengthen fidelity to these EBIs in routine care: Measurement Training and Feedback System for implementation (MTFS-I). MTFS-I will target two essential aspects of EBI fidelity: Training components will seek to improve EBI self-monitoring, and a Feedback component will seek to increase EBI utilization. In keeping with NIMH's Experimental Therapeutics paradigm, this study will examine whether an Intervention (MTFS-I) has direct impact on immediate Targets (EBI self-monitoring and utilization).

If promising, future R01 studies will examine links among intervention, targets, and ultimate outcomes (AEPs). The MTFS-I package will be an online quality assurance system completed by therapists and supervisors that can be readily sustained in usual care. Two weekly Training components will adapt gold-standard observational fidelity coding procedures to promote improved self-monitoring of the targeted EBIs, and a monthly Feedback component will adapt a measurement feedback system to promote increased utilization of these EBIs in everyday practice. To maximize provider investment, sites will delineate their own fidelity standards for family therapy and CBT and help design feedback report templates.

The proposed study will be among the first to (1) test whether training therapists in observational assessment of EBI fidelity increases the accuracy with which they self-monitor use of those EBIs and (2) adapt measurement feedback procedures to track and improve therapist utilization of EBIs. To achieve study aims the investigators will first partner with two community clinics to develop sustainable MTFS-I procedures using a three-phase Pilot process. Investigators will then initiate an experimental Trial during which therapists (n = 32, treating 192 clients) at four different clinics will be randomized to MTFS-I versus no-intervention Control. In both conditions two kinds of data will be collected: therapist-report checklists on use of core family therapy and CBT techniques with adolescent cases and treatment session audio recordings. MTFS-I uptake will be tracked electronically for online components (Aim 1: MTFS feasibility). Session recordings will be coded by observers for three facets of EBI fidelity: adherence (extent of EBI utilization), working alliance, and therapist competence. Observer ratings will measure the strength of EBI self-monitoring (Aim 2: therapist reliability and accuracy) and fidelity (Aim 3 \[EBI utilization\] \& Aim 4 \[alliance, competence\]).

"1140","NCT05744154","Reducing Low-value Care for Trauma Admissions","NOT_YET_RECRUITING","In Canada, injury leads to more potential years of life lost and to greater costs than heart and stroke diseases combined. Furthermore, more than 50% of patients hospitalised following injury do not receive optimal care, 20% of injury deaths are estimated to be preventable, and significant variations in injury mortality and morbidity have been observed across trauma centers in Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia and the United States. Over the past decades, emphasis on adherence to evidence-based processes of care (rewards for doing more) and rapid innovation in imaging and therapeutic techniques has led to an exponential rise in unnecessary tests and procedures. Whole body computed tomography scan for single-system trauma is just one example. Low-value clinical practices, defined as ""the common use of a particular intervention when the benefits don't justify the potential harm or cost"" consume up to 30% of healthcare budgets. They expose patients to physical and psychological adverse events and put enormous pressure on healthcare budgets, thereby threatening accessible, universal health care. The objective of this research project is to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention targeting reductions in low-value clinical practices for injury admissions. The results of this study should directly lead to improvements in the health systems across Canada and elsewhere.

This condition remains associated with a high morbidity and mortality, with hospital mortality of 60% when vasopressors are required.

Full protective isolation (including geographic isolation, technical isolation, high-efficiency air filtration, and digestive decontamination) proved to be efficient in patients with profound and prolonged neutropenia with regard to infection rate. However, these studies are biased and were performed up to 40 years ago. More recent studies, performed in patients with less profound neutropenia, or performed without digestive decontamination or with partial protective isolation led however to negative results. More importantly, isolation has been demonstrated to limit access to patients' room and to be associated with suboptimal monitoring, with increased rate of severe and avoidable adverse events. This may explain the uneven use of protective isolation in hematology ward and expert's suggestion to appraise protective isolation benefits using large well conducted RCT.

In neutropenic patients with suspected sepsis, urgent broad antibiotic therapy is mandatory and failure to initiate adequate antibiotic therapy within 1 hour has been associated with a 10 fold increase in adjusted mortality. Current IDSA guidelines recommend using preferentially large anti-pseudomonas beta-lactam therapy. Routine antibiotic combination using aminoglycosides is controversial and not recommended. On one hand, meta-analyses suggested not-only a lack of benefit from this association but also increased rate of renal failure and a trend towards a higher mortality rate with aminoglycosides use. On the other hand, subgroup analysis and low-level evidences studies suggest however a benefit from aminoglycosides in critically-ill patients, patients with severe sepsis, or those with documented gram negative infection. Along this line, both the recent Cochran systematic review and the recent French guidelines focusing on neutropenia management in critically-ill patients advocated additional trials in this field focusing in the sickest patients.

The current study aims to assess benefits of protective isolation and systematic use of aminoglycosides combination antibiotic therapy in critically-ill patients with cancer-related neutropenia and sepsis or septic shock. To do so, the investigators intend to perform a 2x2 factorial design randomized pragmatic trial comparing on one hand benefits of protective isolation (versus no protective isolation) and in the other hand benefits of systematic aminoglycosides antibiotics combination (versus no systematic combination).","NO","Sepsis|Septic Shock|Hematologic Malignancy|Tumor|Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation","DRUG: Aminoglycosides intervention|BEHAVIORAL: Lack of protective isolation intervention|OTHER: No systematic aminoglycosides intervention - standard arm|OTHER: Protective isolation intervention - standard arm","Mortality, Overall death, at day 90","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT","PHASE3",340,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: FACTORIAL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT","2022-09","2024-06","2024-06","2022-07-05","","2022-07-05","","drug"

As more than three fourth of the global burden of cardiometabolic diseases are related to risk factors connected with lifestyles or behaviors, such as smoking, unhealthy eating, low physical activity, and harmful consumption of alcohol. This burden could be dramatically reduced by changing individual behaviors. This study is focused on interventions that are aimed to improve the adherence to treatment in cardiovascular disease (hypertension), based on a Behavioral Economics approach. Most of public policies targeted to tackle NCDs utilize a rational economic model of behavior. Behavioral economics, by using insights from cognitive psychology and other social sciences, has drawn a lot of attention for its potential to increase healthy behaviors. Interventions informed by BE principles seek to rearrange the social or physical environment in such a way to 'nudge' people towards healthier choices and behaviors.

Main objective: to assess whether the implementation of two strategies based on behavioral economics, that include the use of a financial incentive scheme and specific framing to beneficiaries (i.e. mobile health interventions), increase the referral, evaluation and follow-up of people with moderate and high cardiovascular risk in the public health network, compared to the usual strategy.

Design: A cluster-randomized pragmatic clinical trial will be performed. The randomization unit will be the Community Health Centers (CHC) and the intervention groups (2 arms) or control will be assigned to 9 health centers in total (3 CHC per arm).

Population: This RCT is going to be conducted in selected CHC of Salta. Nine CHC will be selected, which will be randomized: 3 centers to the control, 3 centers to framing intervention with messages and 3 centers to the intervention with incentives.

"1159","NCT02917954","Electronic Patient Reported Outcome (ePRO) Mobile Application Pragmatic Trial","COMPLETED","Canadian and international health care systems require solutions on how to address the needs of a relatively small population that take up a large portion of health care resources. In Ontario, 10% of the population accounts for 79% of total system costs, with similar trends found in other parts of Canada and internationally. Most high-cost users are seniors, older adults, with multiple chronic conditions and complex care needs who are living in the community. Beyond the cost issues, older adults experiencing multi-morbidity are at higher-risk of poor health outcomes and experience lower quality of life as compared to individuals experiencing single illness only.

Since April 2013 the electronic Patient Reported Outcomes (ePRO) mobile application and portal, has undergone a multi-phased, user-centred design evaluation approach to develop a tool designed to meet the needs of older adults with complex care needs and their primary care providers. The ePRO tool is designed to collect person-centred, person-reported indicators to improve care by supporting primary care delivery and enhancing patient self-management.

The ePRO tool includes two features: 1) My Goal Tracker and 2) Health Journal. My Goal Tracker allows patients and providers to collaboratively create goal-oriented patient care-plans, and helps patients to track outcomes related to their goals using a mobile device. The Health Journal allows patients, their caregivers and primary care providers to monitor patients' symptoms and outcomes. The ePRO tool was re-evaluated and modified following each previous study phase (I-IV). This project marks the final phase of the study in which the investigators will conduct a pragmatic trial of the ePRO tool in 8-16 Family Health Teams in Ontario through a stepped-wedge randomized trial with an embedded case study.

"1160","NCT02193451","Urodynamics for Prostate Surgery Trial; Randomised Evaluation of Assessment Methods","UNKNOWN","Background and study aims: The prostate gland sits around the exit of the bladder in men. As men get older, the prostate grows, and this can narrow the exit from the bladder, so that there is restriction of flow. As a result, some men develop difficulty passing urine (voiding) as they age. For these men, prostate surgery can be helpful by removing the part of the prostate causing the narrowing, so that flow improves. However, for some men, almost identical symptoms of difficulty passing urine are due to underactive bladder. In other words, the bladder contraction is too weak, and is not effective at expelling the urine. This is a smaller group, but important, as these men may have no improvement after prostate surgery, while being exposed to risk of complications of surgery. Medical assessment of men with voiding problems typically involves discussing the symptoms, doing a physical examination of the prostate and measuring the urine flow rate. In many NHS hospitals, these are the only tests done before deciding whether to proceed to prostate surgery. In effect, voiding symptoms are presumed to be a result of prostate enlargement for these men, since it is the more common problem compared with bladder underactivity. However, this approach cannot identify which men actually have bladder underactivity as the cause of their voiding symptoms. So, in some hospitals an extra test is used, called urodynamics. Urodynamics is done to measure how much pressure the bladder generates when passing urine, because a high pressure shows the problem is obstruction, and a low pressure shows it is bladder weakness. Urodynamics involves gently putting a small tube into the bladder via the penis to measure the bladder pressure, and to fill the bladder with a sterile fluid (saline). Another small tube is gently placed into the rectum, via the anus, to measure abdominal pressures. Measuring abdominal pressure is necessary because any change in abdominal pressure can affect bladder pressure, and if the test did not allow for this it could give a misleading result. Urodynamics is safe, but some men find it uncomfortable or undignified, and a few develop urine infection afterwards. No studies have been conducted so far to tell us which of these two approaches to assessing men with voiding urinary problems is better overall.

UPSTREAM consists of two phases: ""UPSTREAM - Phase I"" was a pragmatic, two-arm, multicentre, randomised controlled trial (RCT) to determine the clinical and cost-effectiveness of invasive urodynamics (UDS) for the diagnosis and management of bladder outlet obstruction in men. Men from 26 urology departments of NHS Hospitals in England who had bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and were seeking further treatment, which may have included surgery, were randomised to one of two study arms; 'Routine Care' (as per the NICE diagnostic pathway), or routine care plus UDS ('Urodynamics'), which is currently optional. The design was utilised to establish noninferiority in symptom severity (International Prostate Symptom Score \[IPSS\]) 18-months post-randomisation. The primary outcome was IPSS at 18-months post-randomisation, and a key secondary outcome was the influence of UDS on rates of bladder outlet surgery. The RCT started 01 April 2014 and ended 30 September 2018.

In 2018, we were awarded an extension to conduct a further (long term) follow up of UPSTREAM participants, five years post-randomisation; ""UPSTREAM - Phase II"". We aim to identify: the symptom outcomes of treatment; definitive surgery rates in the two study arms; and the long-term impact of LUTS and its therapy. The focus will continue to be on effectiveness and patient outcomes as per the original commissioning brief. ""UPSTREAM - Phase II"" started 01 July 2019 and has a planned end date of 30 June 2022.","NO","Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms|Voiding Dysfunction|Benign Prostate Obstruction|Detrusor Underactivity","PROCEDURE: Urodynamics|PROCEDURE: Usual care","International Prostate Symptom Score, Primary clinical outcome: difference in lower urinary tract symptom (LUTS) between the two arms at 18 months, measured with the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), 18 months","MALE","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,820,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: DIAGNOSTIC","2014-04","2018-07","2022-06-30","2014-07-17","","2020-01-10","North Bristol NHS Trust, Bristol, BS10 5NB, United Kingdom","procedure"

In hypertensive patients, low salt diet decreases blood pressure. Not surprisingly public health authorities endorse low salt diet in hypertensive patients. But, surprisingly, average salt intake among adults in Canada remains stubbornly high. Low effectiveness of ""fast counselling"" by physicians and nurses on dietary salt is partly the culprit. Methods used in successful clinical trials (eg. provision of meals, community cooking sessions, many hours of counselling by dieticians) cannot be used in routine clinical practice. Hence the investigators propose a study on a pragmatic dietary counselling method suitable for clinical practice.

This counselling will include two components: a one hour counselling session, and 4, once-weekly telephone calls.

Effectiveness of this counselling will be measured by checking sodium in the urine from a 24 hour collection (which is a measure of dietary salt intake) at baseline and at 4 weeks.

This can be achieved through a systematic screening of these conditions using innovative and digital solutions implemented in routine health care.

This study aims to evaluate the implementation of a screening programme for migrants at primary care level in two different settings of Spain (Catalonia and Andalusia) using an innovative digital and user-friendly software tool (ISMiHealth). In Catalonia, the ISMiHealth tool has already been integrated into the Electronic Patient Record (EPR) system (eCAP) as part of a pilot study in 2018; currently, the research team aims to validate the tool in a higher number of primary care centres in this area. Therefore, a pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial will be conducted with two parallel groups, in which selected centres using the novel software ISMiHealth will be compared to others that follow the current routine practice. On the other hand, in Andalusia a pilot cluster randomised controlled trial will be carried out, where the ISMiHealth tool will be implemented in the EPR system (DIRAYA) to evaluate the preliminary effectiveness of the tool in other settings.

The ISMiHealth software is a clinical decision support system that provides recommendations for primary healthcare professionals on screening for targeted conditions. It currently includes: 7 communicable diseases (Human immunodeficiency virus, Hepatitis B and C virus, Tuberculosis, Chagas diseases, strongyloidiasis and schistosomiasis) and one key health condition (female genital mutilation). Through routinely collected variables (country of birth, age, and sex), the software performs an individualised risk assessment and provides real-time prompts to healthcare professionals on screening for the selected health conditions.

The objective of this quality improvement (QI) initiative is to evaluate the adherence to and impact of implementing standardized attending morning rounds on medicine teams at our institution. A standardized rounding intervention has been developed which includes specific guidance on completing the following activities during morning rounds: (1) Pre-rounds discretion; (2) Pre-rounds huddle; (3) Bedside registered nurse (RN) integration; (4) Patient-centered rounding; (5) Real-time order writing.

This trial will randomize half of the investigators' medicine teams at University of California San Francisco to this rounding intervention whilst the other half will be randomized to continue with usual unstandardized rounding practices.

The investigators will compare medicine teams randomized to undertake standardized rounding to those teams undertaking usual practice. Outcomes assessed will relate to the patient (e.g. satisfaction), providers (e.g. satisfaction), efficiency (e.g. total morning round time) as well as adherence to the intervention .

Ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring (ABPM) allows for assessment of BP throughout the day and night. Of all the BP measurements, nighttime systolic BP appears to be the best predictor of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. Importantly, elevated nighttime BP is a modifiable risk factor; evening dosing of antihypertensive medications lower nighttime BP and reduces proteinuria. In a large, randomized controlled trial, evening dosing of antihypertensive medications reduced the hazard rate for major cardiovascular events by 67%. Findings were similar in the subgroup of participants with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, this single-center study was designed to evaluate cardiovascular outcomes, not progression of CKD. The long-term effect of nighttime dosing of antihypertensive medications on progression of CKD is unknown.

"1183","NCT03069547","Comparison of Exercise Therapies for Patellofemoral Pain","COMPLETED","Patellofemoral Pain (PFP) is a common knee problem, primarily affecting adolescents and young adults. PFP is characterised by significant retropatellar and/or peripatellar pain and impairment of function and quality of daily life. Exercise therapy is unequivocally recommended as a core component of the management of PFP. Different exercise types (e.g. quadriceps strengthening, hip strengthening and functional/neuromuscular exercises) have been investigated, with knee and hip strengthening exercises as the most common and recommended types. These exercises approaches produce similar small to moderate effects on pain and physical function. However, the PFP population is very heterogeneous and ""one-size-fits-all""-approaches presumably are sub-optimal because the heterogeneity is ignored. The heterogeneity probably explains the overall limited beneficial effects of exercise, and the lack of differences in direct comparisons of different exercise types. In that sense, it is not unlikely that certain patient characteristics may predict outcome success of either a hip training program or a training program that focus on the quadriceps but this remains to be shown.

This study has two aims:

1. To assess the comparative effectiveness of two different exercise programs (Quadricep Exercise \[QE\] vs. Hip Exercise \[HE\]) on self-reported pain and function in individuals with PFP.
2. To explore candidate patient characteristics that predict differential responses to the two exercise programs (QE vs HE) on self-reported pain and physical function in individuals with PFP.

According to the study aims we pursue the following hypothesis:

"1184","NCT01352247","Total or Partial Knee Arthroplasty Trial","UNKNOWN","In the majority of patients with osteoarthritis of the knee the disease originates in the medial compartment. There are two different approaches to replacing this arthritic area. Some surgeons feel that it is always best to replace both the knee compartments with a Total Knee Replacement (TKR). Others feel it is best to replace just the damaged component of the knee with a Unicompartmental Knee Replacement (UKR). There is little agreement amongst knee surgeons. Both interventions are established and well documented procedures, yet little evidence exists to support either practice. Each intervention is considered standard care. There exists little evidence, however, to prove the clinical and cost effectiveness of either management option.

The aim of the Total or Partial Knee Arthroplasty Trial (TOPKAT) will be to assess the clinical and cost effectiveness of Total Knee Replacements versus Unicompartmental Knee Replacements in patients with medial osteoarthritis. This will be examined using an appropriate patient base and long term assessments.

The trial has a combined device/expertise based allocation depending on the local situation. Surgeons who are in equipoise and have sufficient experience to perform both TKR and UKR, randomisation and allocation can be based on ""device"" (UKR or TKR). The same surgeon will perform the operation for both arms of the study.

For surgeons who hold a preference for one treatment over the other, an ""expertise"" based randomisation will then occur. UKR surgeons will work alongside TKR surgeons. Patients recruited to the study from these sites will be randomised to one of the treatment options and treated by the appropriate surgeon. In such cases the patient is internally referred to the other surgeon's operating list.

Patients will be recruited by their consultant knee surgeons in collaboration with the local research team. TOPKAT are hoping to recruit 500 patients altogether, with 250 per arm of the trial.","NO","Knee Osteoarthritis","PROCEDURE: Unicompartmental Knee Replacement|PROCEDURE: Total Knee Replacement","Pain and Function, This will be measured by using the Oxford Knee Score, a patient reported outcome questionnaire., Year 5 (additional extended follow-up to 10 years)","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,500,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT","2010-01","2018-09","2023-12","2011-05-11","","2020-11-05","Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre NHS Trust, Oxford, Oxfordshire, OX3 7LD, United Kingdom","procedure"

Most Americans will have at least one episode of low back pain in their lifetimes. Approximately 50% of all US Veterans have chronic pain, and CLBP is the most common type of pain in this population. This study will use a sequential randomized, pragmatic, 2-step comparative effectiveness study design. The main goal is to identify the best approach for treating cLBP using commonly recommended non-surgical and non-pharmacological options. The first step compares continued care and active monitoring (CCAM) to internet-based pain self-management (Pain EASE) and an enhanced physical therapy intervention that combines Pain EASE with tailored exercise and physical activity. Patients who do not have a significant decrease in pain interference (a functional outcome) in Step 1 and those desiring additional treatment will be randomized in Step 2 to yoga, spinal manipulation therapy (SMT), or therapist-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Participants proceeding to randomization in Step 2 will be allowed to exclude up to one of the three Step 2 treatments based on their preferences. The investigators' primary hypothesis for the first treatment step is that an enhanced physical therapy intervention that combines pain self-management education with a tailored exercise program will reduce pain interference greater than internet-based pain self-management alone or CCAM in Veterans with cLBP. The primary outcome is change in pain interference at 3 months, measured using the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) pain interference subscale.

"1189","NCT04222205","Spontaneous Breathing Trial With T-piece or Inspiratory Pressure Augmentation","RECRUITING","Weaning is an important process to gradually separate mechanically ventilated patients from ventilators. A good weaning strategy aims to early identify mechanically ventilated patients who are ready for extubation but not to prematurely extubate them. Spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) is a test to assess the patient's ability to breathe spontaneously when extubated. Several methods have been used to conduct an SBT, including T-piece breathing, low-level pressure support ventilation (PSV) of 5-7 cm H2O, continuous positive airway pressure and automatic tube compensation (ATC).

The investigators hypothesized that an SBT with inspiratory pressure augmentation increases initial SBT success, reduces the length of invasive mechanical ventilation (iMV) support and does not increase reintubation risk as compared with T-piece, which result in a higher proportion of patients successfully liberated from iMV in the inspiratory pressure augmentation group. However, inspiratory pressure augmentation significantly reduces work of breathing on an SBT as compared with T-piece. Patients extubated following an SBT with inspiratory pressure augmentation may experience increased respiratory effort after extubation and this may increase the use of noninvasive ventilation after extubation. An SBT with inspiratory pressure augmentation increases iMV free days but not MV free days as compared with T-piece. Longer iMV free days may be associated with a lower mortality due to fewer iMV related complication.

This study is a pragmatic, cluster-randomized, multiple crossover, multicenter trial to compare SBTs with T-piece versus inspiratory pressure augmentation in weaning outcomes. Mechanically ventilated patients who meet the criteria for readiness to SBT will be included. The patients will use either T-piece or inspiratory pressure augmentation as SBT for weaning according to an ICU-based cluster randomization and crossover sequence.","NO","Ventilator Weaning","DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) crossover sequence 1|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) crossover sequence 2","Successful liberation from invasive mechanical ventilation, The primary study endpoint is to compare the effect of SBT with T-piece versus inspiratory pressure augmentation on the proportion of patients with successful liberation from invasive mechanical ventilation in the ICU among patients who have started an SBT.

Between 20 and 40% of patients in primary care, and about 50% in secondary care experience PPS. Not only are PPS common, but the overlap across different patient groups may indicate that these phenomena are transdiagnostic. PPS are associated with profound disability and high health care costs, and if left untreated the prognosis of these patients is poor. There is an accumulating body of evidence demonstrating that cognitive behavioural interventions can reduce levels of symptoms and improve functioning in patients with PPS. A pragmatic randomised controlled trial (RCT) was designed to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) + Standard Medical Care (SMC) versus Standard Medical Care alone, in the treatment of patients with PPS. The trial will focus on patients with a variety of symptoms (e.g., non-cardiac chest pain, fibromyalgia), across secondary care clinics (e.g., neurology, cardiology, and rheumatology).","NO","Persistent Physical Symptoms (PPS)","BEHAVIORAL: Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)","Work and social adjustment scale, Measures impairment in functioning, 52 weeks post randomisation","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,324,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT","2015-07","2019-01","2019-01","2015-04-27","","2019-05-09","Guy's Hospital, London, United Kingdom|King's College Hospital, London, United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth Hospital, London, United Kingdom|Royal Free Hospital, London, United Kingdom|St Thomas' Hospital, London, United Kingdom|University Hospital Lewisham, London, United Kingdom|Princess Royal University Hospital, Orpington, United Kingdom","behavioral"
"1201","NCT03372707","Cuff Leak Test and Airway Obstruction in Mechanically Ventilated ICU","COMPLETED","Introduction: Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation are lifesaving interventions that are commonly done in the intensive care unit (ICU). The act of intubating someone can cause laryngeal edema (LE) that, if extensive enough, can cause airway obstruction after a patient is extubated. To date, the only test that is available to predict this complication is the cuff leak test (CLT). However, its diagnostic accuracy is uncertain as there have been no randomized controlled trials (RCT) examining this. The Cuff leak and airway Obstruction in Mechanically ventilated ICU patients (COMIC) Randomized Control Trial will be done to examine the impact of CLT on postextubation stridor and reintubation. Subsequently, describing the diagnostic accuracy of this test.

Methods: This will be a multi-center centered, pragmatic, double blinded RCT. Mechanically ventilated patients in the ICU, who are deemed ready to be extubated will be included. All patients will have a CLT done prior to extubation. The results of the CLT in the intervention arm will be communicated to the treating physician, and decision to extubate will be left to the treating team, while the results of the CLT for patients in the control arm will not be communicated to the treating physician, and the patient will be extubated, regardless of the result of the CLT.

Objective: This is a pilot trial to assess feasibility of conducting a powered RCT. Feasibility outcomes include: consent rate, recruitment rate, and protocol adherence. Clinical outcomes will include postextubation stridor, reintubation, emergency surgical airway, ICU mortality, in hospital mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, and ICU length of stay in days.","NO","Laryngeal Edema","DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Cuff Leak Test","Consent Rate, A successful consent rate will be defined as 70% of substitute decision makers (SDMs) or patients approached to consent, choosing to participate in the trial.

The adherence will be calculated as the proportion of patients that were assigned to the control arm being extubated after CLT being performed and the portion of people that assigned to the intervention arm who are given the prescribed steroids for a failed CLT. As this pilot trial is ongoing, investigators will review adherence monthly and investigate the reasons for compliance failure. All reasons for either failure to extubate after a failed CLT in the control arm will be investigated.

To evaluate the impact of an individualized nutrition intervention package on pressure injury healing rates, prevention of new pressure injuries, complications, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness in adult on home nursing care with pressure injuries staged II and above in Singapore.

Study Design:

A two-group, non-blinded, randomized, pragmatic clinical trial with a cost-effectiveness analysis.

Location/ Setting:

Community

Participants:

Adults (aged 21 years and above) receiving home nursing care with at least one pressure injury (Stage II, III, IV, or Unstageable).

190 subjects per arm

Intervention:

The intervention group will receive an individualized nutrition intervention package consisting of individualized nutritional supplementation, specialized nutritional education pamphlets, regular dietetic support via home visits or telehealth, and home nursing care by nurses trained in nutrition care.

The control group will receive specialized nutritional educational pamphlets, and home nursing care by nurses trained in nutrition care, with or without nutritional supplementation.

Outcome Measures:

Main outcomes of wound area reduction, and proportion of participants with \>40% area reduction at 30 days, 60 days and 90 days. Secondary outcomes include proportion of participants and wounds with increasing severity of PI stages (e.g., stage II to stage III), improvement in Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) and nutritional status, and incidence of wound infections at 30 days, 60 days and 90 days, proportion of participants with complete healing, mortality and unplanned hospital admissions.

Economic Evaluation:

The primary economic outcome will be the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per pressure injury prevented, with a time horizon of 1 year for intervention versus control during the period of intervention (3-months) and up to a year.

Statistical Analyses:

Individual patient level analysis will be performed as per our primary analysis, and we will also perform cluster level analysis. Hazard ratios (HR) will be determined using Cox proportional hazards models and their corresponding 95% Conﬁdence Intervals (95%CI). Imbalances in individual level data will be accounted for using statistical adjustment in a Mixed-Effects Cox Regression model.

Hypothesis:

This study aims to provide evidence on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a individualized and protocolized nutrition intervention package for pressure injury management in home care patients.

"1205","NCT02204956","Smoking Cessation Following Psychiatric Hospitalization","UNKNOWN","Smoking rates among individuals with psychiatric disorders are disproportionately higher than the general population. The majority of psychiatric hospitals ban smoking on hospital grounds, thus providing an opportunity for inpatients to experience abstinence. Yet smokers in inpatient psychiatric settings are infrequently provided with referrals for cessation treatment on discharge (\< 1 %) and most resume smoking upon discharge. Therefore, the integration of effective cessation interventions within the current mental health treatment system is a public health priority.

The overall objective of this project is to adapt a Sustained Care (SusC) model to smokers with severe mental illness (SMI) engaged in a psychiatric hospitalization and to conduct a randomized, pragmatic effectiveness trial designed to assess the benefit of this adapted SusC intervention in real-world practice. We will test the hypothesis that, among smokers with SMI in inpatient psychiatric treatment (n = 422), SusC will result in significantly greater rates of cotinine-validated, 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 6- and 12-months compared to a group that receives Usual Care (UC) about smoking cessation. Furthermore, we hypothesize that a higher proportion of SusC vs. UC patients will use evidence-based smoking cessation treatment (counseling and pharmacotherapy) in the month after discharge. We will also explore the effect of SusC on health and health care utilization in the 12 months post-discharge (psychiatric symptoms, psychiatric and medical hospital readmissions and emergency room visits) and the effectiveness of SusC on smoking abstinence in patient diagnostic subgroups.

The expected outcome of this project is a demonstration of the effectiveness of a Sustained Care intervention for smoking cessation in individuals with severe mental illness (SMI) following psychiatric hospitalization. Future studies could extend these findings to individuals with SMI receiving outpatient psychiatric treatment or psychotherapy. Overall, this research would have a significant positive public health impact that will move us closer to the long-term goal of dissemination and integration of the Sustained Care model to increase smoking cessation and decrease smoking related morbidity and mortality in people with severe mental illness.","NO","Nicotine Dependence","BEHAVIORAL: Sustained Care|BEHAVIORAL: Usual Care","Biochemically verified smoking abstinence via saliva cotinine, 6 months","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,422,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","2015-07","2018-06","2019-06","2014-07-31","","2018-05-11","Seton Shoal Creek Hospital, Austin, Texas, 78731, United States","behavioral"

"1217","NCT05413642","COVID-19 Algorithm Treatment at Home","WITHDRAWN","The newly recognised disease COVID-19 is caused by the Severe-Acute-Respiratory-Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which rapidly spread globally in late 2019, reaching pandemic proportions. The clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection is broad, encompassing asymptomatic infection, mild upper respiratory tract illness and mild extrapulmonary symptoms, and severe viral pneumonia with respiratory failure and even death.

For COVID-19, most primary care physicians have initially treated their patients at home according to their judgment, with various treatment regimens they believe are most appropriate based on their experience/expertise. We recently published a note on how we were treating patients at home based on the pathophysiology underlining the mild/moderate symptoms at the onset of the illness and the proposal of simple drugs that theoretically better fit these mechanisms.

Because the common early mild symptoms of COVID-19 highlight a systemic inflammatory process, there is the recommendation of using anti-inflammatory agents to limit excessive host inflammatory responses to the viral infection, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and corticosteroids. Moreover, COVID-19 patients are exposed to the risk of thromboembolic events and anticoagulant prophylaxis is recommended even at home, in particular settings, unless contraindicated.

In an academic matched-cohort study, we found that early treatment of COVID-19 patients at home by their family doctors according to the proposed recommendation regimen almost completely prevented the need for hospital admission (the most clinically relevant outcome of the study along with death) due to progression toward more severe illness (2 out of 90 patients), compared to patients in the 'control' cohort who were treated at home according to their family physician's assessments (13 out of 90 patients). However, the rate of hospitalization was a secondary outcome of the study and the possibility of a casual finding cannot be definitely excluded. Moreover, these findings were achieved in a retrospective observational study with two matched cohorts of COVID-19 patients, a possible additional limitation of the robustness of the conclusions that would deserve further validation. Thus, we have considered the observed reduction in patient hospitalization a hypothesis generating finding to be confirmed.

In this pragmatic, prospective, three-months, cluster randomized, open-label, blinded endpoint (PROBE) clinical trial, we will compare two groups of family doctors according to a randomized approach, who will treat their COVID19-patients with the proposed recommendation algorithm or other treatment regimens they normally feel appropriate according to their usual clinical practice, and monitor them longitudinally up to 3 months.

Our working hypothesis is that following the proposed recommendation algorithm the early COVID-19-related inflammatory process is limited, preventing the need of hospital admission at larger extent than with other therapeutic approaches also targeting early symptoms of the illness at home.

Should the findings be confirmed, the tested standardized treatment protocol would achieve major benefits for patients with early COVID-19 in particular in relation to a remarkably reduced risk of hospitalization that is expected to translate into reduced morbility and, possibly, mortality. Notably, these expected clinical benefits would be associated with remarkably reduced treatment costs related to reduced hospitalization.","NO","COVID-19","DRUG: Recommended treatment schedule|DRUG: Usual care","proportion of patients who reach score ≥ 5 of MEWS, an index of the need of hospitalization, in the two treatment groups, From beginning the proposed recommended treatments or other therapeutic regimens, assessed up to 90 days)","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT","PHASE3",0,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT","2023-07-01","2024-02-06","2024-02-06","2022-06-10","","2024-02-14","","drug"

We will also explore the reasons for any apparent gaps in DUD care by analyzing clinicians' free-text encounter notes using manual chart review, natural language processing (NLP), and/or NLP-assisted manual chart review, as appropriate (Aim 2).

Specific Project Aims are as follows:

Aim 1 The primary research question we address in Aim 1 is whether routine screening for drug use disorders in primary care (PC) settings increases DUD treatment. We define DUDs as including opioid use disorders (OUD), cannabis use disorders (CUD), and other non-alcohol drug use disorders (OTH). Previously published analyses indicate that the 22 PC clinics in this trial sustained very high rates of screening (88%) and a 3-clinic DUD pilot study suggested that this screening resulted in increased diagnosis of CUD and increased treatment of DUDs in general, even at relatively low observed rates of PC-based screening and assessment.

Aim 2

The overall goal of Aim 2 is to expand our understanding of gaps in DUD diagnosis and treatment that persist-despite implementation of high rates of PC screening and assessment for SUDs-using rich information available only in free-text chart notes. Through analysis of relevant chart notes Aim 2 of this project will descriptively characterize gaps in DUD diagnosis and DUD treatment (i.e., instances where information in a patient's record suggests a DUD could be diagnosed but no diagnosis is present, or a new diagnosis suggest treatment is indicated but no evidence of treatment is present), and characterize reasons for DUD care gaps.","NO","Cannabis-Related Disorder|Cannabis Abuse|Drug Abuse|Drug Use Disorders|Opioid Use Disorder|Opioid Abuse|Substance Abuse|Substance Use Disorders","OTHER: Care Delivery Improvement Intervention","Rate of new drug use disorder treatment using modified HEDIS criteria., A patient has a new episode of treatment for a drug use disorder when: 1) they receive a new diagnosis (i.e., a disorder diagnosis preceded by 365 days without a diagnosis of the same type) for a specific disorder type--OUD, CUD, or OTH, 2) they initiate drug use disorder treatment, defined as evidence of a 2nd encounter coded with the same type of disorder diagnosis 1-14 days following the above defined new diagnosis, and 3) they engage in drug use disorder treatment, defined as two additional encounters coded with diagnoses of the same type of disorder 1-29 days after meeting the above treatment initiation criterion.

Cognitive difficulties with attention, memory, executive functions and so on affect social communication. Without successful social skills, a person may engage in conflicts, become isolated and be denied access to social and vocational opportunities. Internationally, several group interventions have been developed for treating social communication difficulties during the last years.

Group Interactive Structured Treatment (GIST) is a validated holistic multidisciplinary group treatment targeting social communication skills after traumatic brain injury. The main aim of the present study is to examine the efficacy of GIST for improving social communication in persons with acquired brain injury, including TBI, stroke, tumor ect. Secondary the study aims to compare the standard GIST protocol to an newly developed intensive GIST protocol. Efficacy will be assessed immediately after intervention, but also three and six months after the intervention.

However, this approach poses a bleeding risk with only a minimal reduction in thromboembolic events.

After 3 months, a CT scan will be conducted to assess the presence of thrombosis on the newly implanted TAVI valve. Based on the results of a 4D CT scan, the decision will be made whether the patient should receive no anticoagulant or antithrombotic therapy with apixaban.

"1246","NCT05093452","MOTIVAC-MATER-Confiance","COMPLETED","CONTEXT Vaccination has reduced mortality and morbidity by controlling many vaccine-preventable diseases. To prevent recurrence of these diseases, high vaccine coverages (VCs) (≥ 95%) are needed. But VCs for infants remain suboptimal, and four out of 10 parents doubt the safety and efficacy of vaccines in France. The Ministry of Health therefore decided in July 2017 to expand vaccination requirements to 11 valences now required to enter in young children collective structures. This measure, which went into effect in January 2018, has produced significant effects on VCs, but despite this, vaccine hesitancy (VH) persists in the general population at a prevalence level that fluctuates around 20% to 25%.

Motivational interviewing is a collaborative conversational style that reinforces a person's own motivation and commitment to behavior change. It has been successfully tested in multiple domains related to health behavior change. It has also been adapted in Quebec in the area of vaccination and tested in maternity wards with postpartum mothers (Promovac study). Having led to an increase in the VCs of infants by an average of 7 percentage points and a 40% decrease in vaccine hesitancy, this approach has been in the process of being generalized to all maternity units in Quebec since 2017 (EMMIE program). It is indeed proving to be one of the most effective at present in improving confidence in early childhood vaccines.

OBJECTIVES The main objective of this research is to provide proof of concept that, in the French context of mandatory vaccination for infants but also of high rates of VH, an educational strategy based on the principles and techniques of motivational interviewing and carried out with parents in the maternity ward in the days following delivery can reduce vaccine hesitancy (VH).

The secondary objectives are as follows:

* to verify that this reduction in VH is associated with a change in knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs regarding vaccines;
* to verify that this reduction is sustainable (at 12 months);
* to evaluate the acceptability and satisfaction of the interview for the parents

METHODS This is a pragmatic randomized controlled multicenter study with individual randomization unit comparing the impact of motivational interviewing to a standard care with a leaflet on vaccination.

Motivational interviewing will be carried out by trained midwives from the two participating maternity units (one in Marseille (Bouches-du-Rhône) and the other in Toulon (Var)), as part of the routine care provided to parturients. The midwives will be trained by the founding specialist of motivational interviewing in Quebec, during a two and a half day training course. This training will include a presentation of the theoretical foundations of this approach, its adaptation to the field of vaccination, and interactive games to put it into practice. The trained midwives will then be able to put this approach into practice during a one-month pilot period with parturients, during which they will be able to benefit from support in the form of a debriefing. The actual survey will only start at the end of this pilot phase.

In each group, a questionnaire will be offered to the women (couples) who have agreed to participate, both before the motivational interview (or delivery of the leaflet) and after the interview (or delivery of the leaflet). The second questionnaire will be completed before discharge from the maternity hospital. A third evaluation time is planned at 12 months in both groups: it will be carried out by internet or telephone.

The primary endpoint will be the change in the vaccine hesitancy score, measured by an international scale validated in French (Opel scale).

Secondary endpoints will be changes in knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about vaccination between the two groups as well as satisfaction with the ME and the brochure.

Randomization will be performed in blocks of 8, prior to acceptance for participation in this research.

EXPECTED BENEFITS If the results of this research provide proof of concept that the educational strategy based on motivational interviewing adapted to the vaccination of infants after delivery, in maternity wards, makes it possible, in the French context, to reduce VH, this will be a major advance in public health in France. Indeed, even if the vaccination obligations introduced in January 2018 have had a positive impact on infant vaccination coverage, VH remains present in parents in a proportion that remains worrying (20 to 25% according to surveys). The results of this research will then allow us to study the conditions for generalizing motivational interviewing in order to reinforce confidence in vaccination, which is lacking in a significant part of the French population.","NO","Vaccination Promotion","BEHAVIORAL: Motivational Interviewing|OTHER: Information flyer","Vaccine hesitancy score (Opel score), Parents' vaccine hesitancy score, regarding vaccination of their child, assessed by a questionnaire before and after the intervention at the maternity ward.

Disparities in HTN prevalence, treatment and control in the US have persisted for decades. The prevalence of HTN is 44% among Blacks, which is among the highest rates in the world. Those in ethnic/racial, rural, socioeconomically disadvantaged and other medically underserved populations are known to have the worst blood pressure (BP) control. Awareness of, treatment for, and control of HTN is not optimal, and varies according to race, whereby BP is controlled in \~53% of non-Latino Whites, 42% of non-Latino Blacks and only 34% of Latinos. Fundamental underlying differences in the pathophysiology contribute to HTN among different race groups. The United States (US) 2014 HTN recommendations outline race-based pharmacotherapy care for HTN. However, these recommendations use race-based population assumptions for Whites and Blacks only, do not include Latino ethnicity and have no accompanying guidelines or tools for successful implementation, particularly in rural primary care practices where disparate populations are common. Moreover, these recommendations only apply to initial therapy and lack guidance on subsequent regimen selection. The Optimizing Precision of HTN Care to Maximize BP Control Pilot (OPTI-BP Pilot), will directly address a long known and growing health disparity concern in the US which includes higher rates of death from CHD and stroke among Blacks and the poorest rates of HTN control among Latinos. Utilizing a mixed methods approach, the overarching goal of OPTI-BP Pilot is to test, using a pragmatic trial design, a personalized, algorithmic-based HTN management approach focused on age, race, biomarker (plasma renin activity) and treatment factors. The investigators hypothesize that implementation of a precision-based approach to the care of HTN in the community will improve BP reduction and ultimately reduce risk for CHD, stroke and death among those most affected by HTN.OPTI-BP Pilot is significant because it will utilize an innovative, systematic, precision-focused HTN management approach in an underserved, diverse population where BP control is currently suboptimal and lays the infrastructure groundwork for broad implementation across all areas of the US to minimize HTN related disparities and improve HTN outcomes.","NO","High Blood Pressure","OTHER: HTN PRA App|OTHER: Blood Sample","BP control, We will measure BP control in patients who underwent PRA testing.

"1250","NCT02721485","Crystalloid FLUID Choices for Resuscitation of Hospital Patients","COMPLETED","Salt fluids are used extensively for acutely ill patients who are admitted to hospital. Two salt fluids commonly used are Normal Saline and Ringer's Lactate. Both are used to rehydrate patients, restore fluid volume and help stabilize blood pressure and failing organs. Both salt fluids have been used for several decades. Until recently, it was thought the fluids are essentially equivalent other than some minor differences related to the concentration of salt components (sodium and chloride) and buffers (Ringer's Lactate has lactate as a buffer). Recent data suggest that salt fluids containing less chloride like the Ringer's Lactate, cause less acid in the blood, less kidney failure, and less death. However, the studies to date are small and weak in their design and it is possible that there are no important differences that affect patients. Hence, the research team will conduct a robust pragmatic clinical trial where several academic and community hospitals will be randomized to use either Ringer's Lactate only or Normal Saline only for a period of three months. The trial will yield high quality and robust data to determine if Ringers Lactate reduces death and re-admissions to hospital. Before embarking on this large-scale trial, it is important to conduct a smaller (pilot) trial to evaluate if the larger trial will be feasible and not too costly. In this small trial involving no less than 4 hospitals, the investigators will determine how well the fluid interventions are adhered to in each hospital, record how long it takes to receive approval from research ethics boards and be ready to start the study.

Three quarters of stroke survivors will live with minor to severe impairments or disabilities; which require rehabilitation care. Strong evidence supports beginning rehabilitation as soon as the patient's medical status has stabilized and continuing following discharge from acute care. Access to optimal services is hampered, however, by travel distances to access rehabilitation, the lack of opportunities for structured and formal interprofessional communication among service providers, and failures to engage the patient and family members in a structured decision making process. Moreover, adherence to rehabilitation treatments has been shown to be suboptimal. Many patients refuse their outpatient rehabilitation treatments outright or decrease the duration and/or frequency of their treatments over time.

The aim of this proposed mixed methods pragmatic clinical trial is to evaluate an intervention that provides patients who have experienced stroke the opportunity to return home safely after their acute hospital stay, to encourage patient (and family) engagement in their rehabilitation care, and to overcome challenges of access to patient-centered interprofessional rehabilitation care.

The proposed intervention will entail 220 patients (and family) to receive rehabilitation care through remote, live treatment sessions with an interdisciplinary group of clinicians (called telerehabilitation) versus standard of care (n = 110 patients). Five rehabilitation teams will be trained to develop rehabilitation treatment plans that engage the patient and family, while taking advantage of a telerehabilitation platform to engage the patient/family. Grounded in findings gathered through a Canadian Institute of Health Research (CIHR) funded pilot study, the primary study objective is to evaluate process, clinical outcomes and costs of telerehabilitation in comparison with usual care. Through qualitative interviews with patients and family as well as clinicians, a second objective of this pragmatic, controlled trial is to explore and describe contextual factors (both personal and environmental) that will help the delivery of care, and improve patient's outcomes while fully using technology to deliver stroke rehabilitation care.

This study represents a unique, highly relevant opportunity to minimize both knowledge and practice gaps, while producing robust, indepth data on the factors related to the effectiveness of telerehabilitation.","NO","Stroke Rehabilitation|Telerehabilitation|Decision Making, Shared","OTHER: Telerehabilitation and team meetings and team care plans|OTHER: Usual care","Patient adherence to stroke rehabilitation plan (Patient journal), Time spent (in minutes) doing any stroke rehabilitation exercises (online + offline).

The unit of randomization will be the inpatient units admitted critically ill patients, with the interventions being carried out over 4 months. The study plans to enroll 14 units at 2 sites. Four sequences will be enrolled into the intervention each month; each sequence will have 3-4 units (see figure 1).

Units eligible for the study will have patients that are critically ill admitted and have had at least 1 CLABSI events over the past 12 months (fiscal year). Given the pragmatic nature of the study design, there will be limited additional inclusion and exclusion criteria. Prior to the beginning the study, all nursing staff (RNs and nursing assistants \[NAs\]) will receive a survey link (RedCAP) to understand their perceptions of CHG bathing. After all units have been enrolled (approximately 4 months), nursing staff will be sent a post-survey to see if their perceptions have improved after the program. Further, the Context Assessment Index (used with permission; via RedCAP) will also be used to assess the context (i.e., culture) in which clinicians works and the effect this has on using evidence in practice. This will be provided to infection prevention champions on each unit one time, at the beginning of enrollment.

All hospitals in the trial will receive access to site-level quality reports on CLABSI data. The interventions will include a ""direct engagement"" at the site level; this strategy will build upon current quality improvement interventions developed from the Agency for Healthcare Research \& Quality for optimization of care for critically ill patients at risk for CLABSIs. The multidisciplinary teams will include national key opinion leaders in quality improvement working with local infection prevention specialists and support staff to help healthcare systems and hospitals design or revise quality improvement plans. Units will receive feedback on quality improvement efforts, including audit and feedback reviewing their CHG bathing compliance and CLABSI rates. Duke will serve as the primary statistical center and analysis will be generated by Duke. The only risk in this study is the possibility of breach of confidentiality.

The primary objective of this study is to assess the effect of a customized, multifaceted quality improvement \[QI\] program on compliance with daily chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) bathing per the AHRQ protocol in inpatient units that admit critically ill patients. Further, we will assess the effect of this program on nursing staffs' perception of the importance of CHG bathing. The Context Assessment Index (used with permission) will also be used to assess the context (i.e., culture) in which clinicians works and the effect this has on using evidence in practice.

"1259","NCT02691988","Withdrawal of Inhaled Corticosteroids in Primary Care Patients With COPD","UNKNOWN","Rationale: Because long-term use of ICS is associated with an increased likelihood of side-effects such as increased risk of pneumonia and loss of bone density, it is important to limit prescription of ICS to patients who have a clear indication for this treatment. In addition, avoiding unnecessary treatment with ICS could reduce the burden that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) puts on healthcare budgets. The recently updated COPD guideline of the Dutch college of General Practitioners (NHG) emphasizes the importance of optimizing medical treatment for COPD patients with only limited room for the use of inhaled corticosteroids.

Objective: The objective of the study is to investigate whether discontinuation of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) for patients without a clear indication for ICS according to current guidelines results in a reduction of ICS use without adverse health effects for the patients involved.

Study design: The study is a pragmatic, clustered, parallel group, non-inferiority trial in Dutch general practices with a follow-up of 26 weeks per patient.

Study population: 620 COPD patients with confirmed chronic airflow obstruction, aged ≥ 40 yrs who use ICS for at least the prior 6 months without a clear indication.

Intervention (if applicable): Guided ICS withdrawal in optimised COPD management. All study participants (of both study arms) will receive recommendations on optimal bronchodilator therapy and a personalized action plan to recognize symptom deterioration in an early stage.

Main study parameters/endpoints: Number of exacerbation-free weeks. Secondary study parameters: successful cessation of ICS, time to first exacerbation, number of moderate and severe exacerbations, health-related quality of life, health status, and pneumonias. Moreover, information on the process of care and costs will be collected.

Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: Many COPD patients use ICS without a clear indication. Long-term use of ICS is associated with an increased likelihood of side-effects such as increased risk of pneumonia and loss of bone density and should be avoided in those who do not benefit from it. However, there is a small subgroup of COPD patients that have reduced numbers of exacerbations because of their ICS use and it is impossible to identify a priori the patients who this applies too. Therefore, it is important that the ICS discontinuation is guided to detect potential deteriorations early on.","NO","Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive","OTHER: ICS withdrawal|OTHER: Usual care","Number of exacerbation-free weeks (EFWs), Weeks in which the patient does not experience a worsening of his respiratory condition according to accepted symptom-based definitions of an exacerbation.

There is good evidence that psychological interventions improve patient well-being and independent living, but patients on acute mental health wards often do not have access to evidence-based psychological therapies which are strongly advised by NICE guidance for severe mental health problems (e.g. NICE, 2011). The overall aim of this programme of work is to increase patient access to psychological therapies on acute mental health inpatient wards. Stage one of the programme aimed to identify barriers and facilitators to delivering therapy in these settings through a large qualitative study. The key output of stage one was an intervention protocol that is designed to be delivered on acute wards to increase patient access to psychologically-informed care and therapy. Stage two of the programme aims to test the effects of the intervention on patient wellbeing and serious incidents on the ward which are routinely collated by wards and patient and staff contact is not required (primary outcomes), patient social functioning and symptoms, staff burnout, ward atmosphere from staff and patient perspectives and cost effectiveness of the intervention (secondary outcomes). The study is a single blind, pragmatic, cluster randomised controlled trial and will recruit thirty-four wards across England that will be randomised to receive the new intervention plus treatment as usual, or treatment as usual only. Primary and secondary outcomes will be assessed at baseline and 6-month and 9-month follow-ups, with serious incidents on the ward collected at an additional 3-month follow-up.

However, it is still unclear what the most suitable treatment implementation format is and to what extent therapeutic gains may be generalizable to regular healthcare settings with limited resources.

Methods: A pragmatic randomized controlled trial was conducted ona representative Spanish sample of outpatients with a DSM-5 main diagnosis of borderline personality disorder. Patients were allocated either to a combined (group plus individual) schema therapy format (n=40) or to a group-only schema therapy format (n=40).

"1265","NCT01401556","C-STOP Fracture Trial","COMPLETED","The objective of the proposed research is to improve quality of care for older outpatients who present to Emergency Departments and Fracture Clinics with an osteoporosis-related wrist or other upper extremity fracture. Although most of these patients warrant evidence-based and guideline-recommended osteoporosis testing and treatment, numerous studies demonstrate treatment rates less than 10-20% in the year post-fracture. Several trials, including the investigators own prior studies, have tried to address this osteoporosis care-gap and have reported that various multifaceted interventions (combinations of patient and physician education, guidelines, and physician reminders) can modestly improve treatment rates compared with usual care, although 60-70% of the patients exposed to these interventions still remain untreated. The investigators believe that a case-manager (who identifies and independently sees patients in clinic, arranges bone mineral density \[BMD\] tests, and offers guideline-based treatment to those with low BMD) represents a potential solution that holds great promise.

The investigators hypothesize that an osteoporosis case-manager will effectively and efficiently increase rates of osteoporosis treatment in older outpatients with upper extremity fractures when compared with a documented effective and cost-saving multifaceted intervention. To test this hypothesis the investigators propose a pragmatic patient-level randomized controlled comparative effectiveness trial with blinded outcomes ascertainment that compares the case-manager strategy with the multifaceted intervention.","NO","Osteoporosis","OTHER: case management|OTHER: Multifaceted quality improvement intervention","Proportion of untreated patients newly starting prescription osteoporosis treatment with a bisphosphonate after their fracture, Proportion of previously untreated patients (%) newly starting prescription osteoporosis treatment with a bisphosphonate within 6-months of an upper extremity fragility fracture, 6-months","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,441,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE (INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","2012-09","2019-12","2022-04","2011-07-25","","2022-05-24","University of Alberta Hospitals, Edmonton, Alberta, T6G 2B7, Canada","other"

"1270","NCT02730507","Surgical Treatment of Spinal Deformity With Sagittal Imbalance Using Patient-specific Rods: A Multicenter, Controlled, Double- Blind Randomized Trial: The PROFILE Study","COMPLETED","Lumbar degenerative diseases (LDD) are an increasingly common condition affecting millions of patients worldwide. LDD can impact not only function, but can also become markedly disabling and cause severe chronic pain. Recent studies support the idea that analysis of sagittal balance is a crucial keypoint to optimize the management of lumbar degenerative diseases, especially when spinal instrumentation is intended.

The first treatment of these pathologies is a medical treatment (medications, physical therapy and exercise). Surgical treatment is frequently necessary if the symptoms worsen and is generally a posterior spinal fusion with instrumentation (screws, hooks and rods) and bone graft. Basic principle of the surgery is to realign the spine along the rod.

Despite documented techniques for surgical planning, it appears that a significant number of patients are ultimately under-corrected after surgery Realignment failure has not only been associated with poor functional outcome but also major complications, such as pseudoarthrosis and rod breakage, which often results in additional surgical procedures.

From a pragmatic point of view, there are two main reasons for realignment failure: poor surgical planning and poor execution. One of the assumptions is that perioperative manual bending of the rod may not always allow the surgeon to restore the sagittal parameters as intended.

A new concept of patient-specific rod (PSR) is now being proposed by a French manufacturer in order to enable an optimal correction and surgical stabilization of the spine. PSR are designed to fit with the patient's unique sagittal spine profile and with surgeons' surgical planning. However, no relevant clinical data is currently available to support the expected medical benefit of this new technology.

The objective of the study is therefore to carry out a study hypothesizing that the use of PSR could improve the percentage of patients whose sagittal profile is optimally corrected after spinal surgery, as well as the patient's quality of life.","NO","Spinal Deformity With Sagittal Imbalance","DEVICE: Surgery with patient-specific rod|DEVICE: Conventional straight rod","Proportion of patients whose sagittal profile is optimally corrected between both arms, The primary end point is the proportion of patients whose sagittal profile is optimally corrected 12 months after a spine-surgery.

* Pelvic Tilt is less than 20°
* Sagittal Vertical Axis is less than 40mm. These 3 criteria will be measured and combined to define an optimal sagittal profile, by 3 members of an independent committee. Radiographic parameters will be measured on sagittal full-spine x-rays. The patient positioning will be standardized in order to obtain comparable and reproducible images.

A small PE located in the subsegmental pulmonary vasculature is identified as a subsegmental PE (SSPE). Anticoagulants are used to treat SSPE and work by preventing new clots from forming whilst the body's own mechanisms break down the clots, however they can also increase the risk of major and potentially life threatening bleeding. More recent observational data of routine care for SSPE showed very high complication rates of anticoagulation but in patients where treatment was withheld, this proved to be a safe strategy in terms of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE).

Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) scans are now able to detect SSPE, however there are concerns that there is an over-diagnosis due to the incorrect interpretation of small artefacts. 1466 patients from approximately 50 sites will be recruited, these sites will consist of hospitals across the United Kingdom (UK). Patients 18 and over with isolated SSPE, confirmed by either CTPA or CT thorax with IV contrast, will be eligible for the trial. Patients will be randomised to either receive standard anticoagulation for at least 3 months (control) or no anticoagulation for at least 3 months (intervention). The participant will receive telephone follow up calls at 4, 12 and 24 weeks following the end of their treatment, and additional data will also be taken from their medical records at these time points. The participant isn't required to be contacted for the 52 week follow up as the data will be extracted from the National Health Service (NHS) Digital collection of Hospital Episode Statistics (HES).

Due to ageing the national burden will double in the coming decade. Antidepressants as TCAs and SSRIs are effective in reducing symptoms, especially in people with severe depression. To optimize treatment efficacy and reduce side effects, the Pharmacogenetics Working Group of the Royal Dutch Pharmacists Association developed guidelines for dose-adaptation, for instance for antidepressants such as nortriptyline and venlafaxine based on their main relevant genotype (CYP2D6) accompanied by Therapeutic Drug Monitoring. Such personalized drug dosing based on pharmacogenetic information at the start of therapy can speed up the titration phase of antidepressants to establish an adequate maintenance dose. However, pharmacogenetic screening programs are expensive and evidence on effects and costs of such a program among elderly antidepressant starters from randomized controlled studies is lacking. The investigators will conduct a pragmatic randomized controlled trial to determine the effects and costs of pharmacogenetic screening information to optimize drug dosing in depressed elderly patients who start with nortriptyline or venlafaxine.

Objective: The primary objective is to determine the effects of pharmacogenetic screening for CYP2D6 on the time to reach adequate blood levels as an accepted proxy for adequate treatment. Secondary objectives include adverse drug reactions and cost-effectiveness

"1298","NCT04748588","Treatment of Nosocomial COVID-19","TERMINATED","COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and causes substantial morbidity and mortality. Nosocomial acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 is a frequent concern across hospital settings in Canada and is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. This clinical trial is initially designed to evaluate the role of monoclonal antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, for the treatment of hospitalized patients who acquire COVID19 via nosocomial infection. New treatments, as they become available, may be integrated, with appropriate adaptation of this document. The trial was initiated with the bamlanivimab product with the options of casirivimab/imdesimab and sotrovimab added as the prevalence of bamlanivimab resistant variants of concerns increased.

It is believed that monoclonal antibody treatments are most likely to be effective early in the disease course. The ability to rapidly identify and initiate such treatments in patients with nosocomial acquisition of the infection, combined with the high mortality of 25-30% experienced by this group of patients led us to propose this trial in collaboration with the CATCO national network.

The overall objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and clinical effectiveness of anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody treatment relative to the control arm, in patients who develop nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infection, on need for mechanical ventilation or death.

This study is designed as a pragmatic randomized, open-label, controlled clinical trial.

Subjects will be randomized to receive either standard-of-care (control) or the study medication on a 1:2 basis. Bamlanivimab, casirivimab/imdesimab or sotrovimab will be administered intravenously as a one-time infusion after randomization. Casirivimab/imdesimab (REGN) and sotrovimab will be the default agents based on local availability unless both are unavailable AND virus strain known to be native or alpha (B.1.1.7).

Full intervention participants completed an online workshop on perspective-taking and practiced perspective-taking prior to an in-lab 10-minute dialogue with a trained client-actor (masked to condition) about the actor's physical inactivity. Partial intervention participants received the workshop after the dialogue, and were instructed to be aware and mindful of the approach that they took to seek understanding. To be considered feasible, outcomes needed to meet or surpass our criteria (e.g., within-course recruitment: 85-95% of a course when embedded within a course, 5-10% when not embedded).

"1311","NCT04875793","Effectiveness of an Integrated Colorectal Cancer Screening in Saudi Arabia: A Pragmatic Randomized Trial","COMPLETED","The global burden of colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence among young age groups is rising and overwhelming. This new trend of young-onset CRC incidence is evident in western countries. Unfortunately, Asian countries have shown the same epidemic shift in the past few years. As a consequence, this situation might necessitate revisiting the current screening program in this region.

Saudi Arabia has a two-fold increase in CRC incidence among young age groups in the last 18 years (9.6/100000 for male versus 9.3/100000 for female). This rising incidence ascribed to the lack of a screening program and suggested lowering CRC screening to 40.

The low awareness about risk factors, signs, and symptoms of the disease causes late presentation of CRC cases. Therefore, most presenting cases are associated with a poor prognosis and short survival. Educational and screening programs are, by no means, considered valuable and essential as CRC tends to affect younger age groups.","NO","Colorectal Neoplasms|Colorectal Cancer|Colonic Polyp|Occult Bleeding","DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Stool for Occult Blood Test and Colonoscopy with comprehensive medical checkups","The percentage of individuals who screened positive in the intervention group vs. control group., The comparison of rate positive screening between the intervention and routine care, 1 - 12 months|The enrollment rate of individuals who underwent CRC screening in the intervention group vs. control group, The comparison of the enrollment rate between the intervention and routine care, 1 - 12 months","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,300,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: SCREENING","2021-06-10","2022-06-10","2022-07-10","2021-05-06","","2022-12-07","Public Primary Health Care Centers in the Tabuk City, Tabuk, 71491, Saudi Arabia","diagnostic_test"

As such, clinicians and researchers advocate for the use of interventions targeted at sleep and circadian dysrhythmias as an adjunct to the standard treatments offered for acute illness episodes of a broad range of diagnoses. To determine the trans-diagnostic generalizability of chronotherapy, the investigators will explore the benefits of admitting individuals with major mental disorders to an acute psychiatric inpatient unit where changes in light exposure are integrated into the therapeutic environment.

A two-arm pragmatic effectiveness randomized controlled treatment trial, where individuals admitted for inpatient psychiatric care will be allocated to a ward with blue depleted evening light or to a ward with the same layout and facilities but lacking the new lighting technology. The trial will test whether the experimental lighting conditions offer any additional benefits beyond those associated with usual treatment in an acute psychiatric inpatient unit.

The main objectives are to examine any differences between groups in the mean duration of hospitalization in days. Additional analyses will compare groups differences in sleep, functioning, symptoms, medication usage, and side-effects and whether length of stay is associated with stability of sleep-wake cycles and circadian rhythms. Given this unique research opportunity, ancillary investigations will determine any benefits according to diagnostic subgroups and potential drawbacks such as any adverse effects on the well-being of professionals working across both wards.","NO","Mental Disorder","OTHER: Blue-depleted evening light condition|OTHER: Normal light condition","Duration of admission, The primary outcome measure will be mean duration of admission per individual.

"1315","NCT03249428","E-Cigarette Inner City RCT","UNKNOWN","Tobacco is the most preventable cause of disease and death in Canada. Although the tobacco use rate has substantially gone down in the general population, significant differences exist between sub-populations in Canada, for example Ottawa's highly vulnerable homeless or at-risk for homelessness population has an almost 100% tobacco smoking rate relative to 9-18% in the rest of the Canadian general population. This stark inequity in tobacco use translates into devastating healthcare outcomes such as a disproportionate amount of cancer, stroke, heart disease and death. Canadians who are homeless or at-risk for homelessness die 25 years earlier than housed Canadians, mostly due to tobacco. In order to tackle this tobacco use related inequity - a novel approach is urgently needed. Despite commonly held dogma that People Who Use Drugs (PWUD) don't want to quit smoking, many studies have demonstrated that in fact they are very interested in quitting. Moreover, the investigators pragmatic peer-led community-based action approach used in their PROMPT project has demonstrated that tobacco dependence strategies can be implemented with great success in this population. The majority of PROMPT participants reduced or quit tobacco use, in addition to reducing or quitting all other drug use. Importantly, the investigators have demonstrated that it is possible to gain the trust and engagement of marginalized populations and that researchers can create a community space that is low-threshold, safe and non-judgmental. The investigators aim to compare two tobacco dependence management strategies in the homeless (or at-risk for homelessness) multi-drug use population in Ottawa and Toronto. They will use the same peer-led approach in PROMPT with community peer researchers with lived experience; with the hope that the cost-effective community based framework derived from this trial will serve as a template for interventions and treatments in community settings for chronic diseases such as obesity and diabetes.","NO","Tobacco Dependence|COPD Asthma|Mental Illness|Substance Use","DEVICE: Improved Quality of Life of low-income Canadians that smoke tobacco and other substances","Overall Quality of Life, To assess impact of two tobacco dependence strategies on quality of life (QOL) measured by questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L scores) at 26 weeks, 26 weeks","ALL","CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,200,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: CROSSOVER|Masking: DOUBLE (INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT","2019-09","2021-09","2021-09","2017-08-15","","2019-03-21","The Bridge Engagement Centre, Ottawa, Ontario, K1G 5T2, Canada","device"

"1323","NCT02841683","Pragmatic Randomised Controlled Trial Evaluating Effectiveness of a Smoking Cessation e- Intervention "" Tabac Info Service ""","COMPLETED","Introduction - A national smoking cessation E-intervention, called Tabac Info Service (TIS), was developed in France to provide an adapted web and mobile application support to smoking cessation for all adults smokers, with or without chronic diseases, who want to stop smoking. This paper presents the study protocol of the evaluation of the program. The primary objective of this evaluation is to assess the efficacy and efficacy conditions of eTIS. The secondary objectives are to 1) describe efficacy variations in regard to user characteristics, 2) analyze mechanisms and efficacy conditions of eTIS, through variations of use, social or environmental contextual factors likely to influence the efficacy of eTIS, and the behavior change techniques (BCTs).

Methods and analyses - The study design is a two-arm pragmatic randomized controlled trial including a process evaluation with at least 3000 participants randomized to the intervention or to the control arm (current practices presented in a non-interactive website). Inclusion criteria are: Adults, Smokers with an information and consent form completed, Getting a smartphone and using mobile applications, wanting stop to smoking in short, medium or long terms. The exclusion criterion is the refusal to participate in the study. The primary outcome is the point prevalence abstinence of 7 days at 6 months later. The secondary outcomes are: the point prevalence abstinence of 24 h at 3 months later, the point prevalence abstinence of 30 days at 12 months later, number of quit attempts during the study, progression of stages within the program (changes and duration in each stage). Data will be analyzed in Intention to treat (main analyze) and per protocol ways. A logistic regression will be carried out to estimate an OR \[95% confidence interval\] for efficacy. A multivariate multilevel analysis will explore the influence of patients' characteristics, social and environmental context, conditions of use and behavior change techniques on results.

Dissemination -The findings of this study will allow us to understand and characterize the efficacy of eTIS, and conditions of its efficacy, underlining psychological, sociological, environmental and contextual factors, which could influence the efficacy of this type of intervention on smokers. These findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals, national and international conference presentations and public events.","NO","Tobacco Smoking","BEHAVIORAL: Tabac Info Service","Point prevalence abstinence of 7 days, 6 months","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,2806,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: PREVENTION","2017-09-01","2019-03-01","2019-09-01","2016-07-22","","2020-08-24","université de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, 33000, France","behavioral"

The clinical relevance of this putative difference is however unknown. On the other side, the use of canagliflozin, but not empagliflozin and dapagliflozin, has been associated with an increased risk of some adverse events, namely bone fractures and lower limb amputations.

One of the biggest challenges of psychiatric services is patient disengagement. People with psychosis, are often difficult to engage in community based mental health services (CMHTs). Patient's who disengage from psychiatric care often have higher social care needs, are often more unwell and are more likely to be detained under the Mental Health Act compared to those who engage. It is important to examine the reasons for this for both research and clinical reasons to establish the effectiveness of the service to its users. Importance must be placed on the clinician's perspective of the engagement; the patient's perspective is vital.

This study is a pilot two-arm pragmatic Randomised Control Trial to examine the feasibility of assessing engagement of EIP services through different communication methods. Patients and care-coordinators will use self-reported scales to measure engagement to determine whether this improves through the use of different communication methods.

Patients will be asked to consent to being randomly allocated to one of two groups:

(i.) Receive letters, phone calls and voicemail's from their care coordinator for standard appointments.

OR

(ii.) Receive text messages and emails from their care-coordinator for standard appointments.

Patients eligible for this study will be in their first six months of care under an EIP CMHT and who have consented to take part. They will be aged 18-35, not a hospital inpatient, have access to the Internet, a mobile phone and who are fluent in the English language.

The aim is to compare two surgical treatment methods (metal fixation versus artificial hip) in patients above 65 years with an undisplaced femoral neck fracture. The hypothesis is that even though an artificial hip is a larger surgical procedure than metal fixation of the broken bone, the artificial hip is more stable with less pain due the lack of a healing broken bone and therefore leads to a better and quicker mobilization after surgery. Better mobilization is one of the most important factors for decreasing mortality. We have chosen a pragmatic RCT design by using the local departmental implants.

The study will be conducted at Kaiser Permanente (KP) Washington (the lead site) and at HealthPartners, KP Colorado and KP Northwest. Electronic health records will be used to identify outpatients aged 18 or older who respond to a routinely administered PHQ depression questionnaire by reporting thoughts of death or self-harm ""most of the days"" or ""nearly every day"". This trial will be limited to patients receiving care from one of the four participating health systems. Eligible patients will be automatically assigned to continue in usual care (1/3) or to either of the two intervention programs (1/3 each). Those assigned to usual care will not be contacted at all by study staff and will continue to receive usual care from treating primary care and mental health providers. Both intervention programs involve outreach by Epic secure messaging (with optional telephone outreach for those not reading messages). The Care Management intervention includes routine outreach to assess ongoing risk of suicide attempt and care management to monitor and facilitate ongoing engagement in outpatient follow-up. The Care Manager will coordinate care with treatment by primary and behavioral health care providers using Epic Staff Messaging (or telephone contacts if necessary). The Skills Training intervention uses an online skills training program to support patients in developing and using self-management skills for emotion regulation and crisis management. A Coach will monitor each participant's use of the program and send periodic messages (using Epic secure messaging) to encourage and support use of the program and practice of program skills. Each intervention continues for up to one year. In all three groups (Usual Care, Care Management, and Skills Training) virtual data warehouse data will be used to identify likely suicide attempts over 18 months following randomization. Analyses will compare risk of suicide attempt among all those randomized, regardless of response to the initial invitation or level of participation in the intervention programs.

Factors such that increased life-expectancy and certain life style-related factors, such as smoking, high-fat diet and alcohol-consumption, are commonly associated with the increase in most of the common chronic diseases. However, more complex psychosocial factors such as depression, stress, work-related dynamics and thinking patterns are thought be associated with poor health status and impaired health related quality of life among patients with suffering from chronic physical conditions (i.e. a biopsychosocial approach). Therefore, psychosocial intervention has been suggested as a complementary treatment strategy for patients with chronic conditions.

The long-term goal is to increase access to and uptake of risk-informed evidence-based guidelines that will improve population health through better patient outcomes, higher quality of life, and decreased costs. The three primary aims are:

Aim 1: Develop a scalable implementation framework that guides each unique clinical setting, including low resource settings, in deploying GRACE effectively for the needs of their patients and providers.

Aim 2: Facilitate the potential for genomic medicine to promote population health by broadening access to and uptake of genomic risk assessment by the general population through a pragmatic implementation-effectiveness trial of GRACE.

Aim 3: Reduce health disparities related to genomic medicine by allowing individual adaption of GRACE to suit their level of resources, education, and access within a pragmatic implementation-effectiveness trial.

Three sets of participants will be engaged: patients (n=750), providers (n=25), and family members of ""probands"" (i.e., patients that have a genetic change that increases risk, n\~500).

Patient participants will be asked to complete a baseline survey, enter their family health history information into MeTree (a family health history web-based platform) and complete a survey about their experience using the platform. Subsequent study procedures will depend on: 1) the results of their MeTree risk evaluation, 2) their acceptance/declination of genetic testing (for those categorized as needing testing by MeTree), and 3) the results of the test (for those accepting testing).

Provider participants will be providers who are the primary care physicians treating one or more patients enrolled in the patient participant group. Providers will be notified on a patient by patient basis once the patient participant under their care has complete the risk assessment process and the risk report is available from MeTree.

Few employees receive support to manage their health at work, known as vocational advice, so when their health affects work they visit their general practitioner (GP). The investigators have recently shown the benefits of providing vocational advice for adults consulting in primary care with musculoskeletal pain.

The WAVE study research question is: in patients consulting in general practice who receive a fit note for time off work, does a brief vocational advice intervention lead to fewer days lost from work than usual primary care, and is it cost-effective?

WAVE includes a feasibility phase to adapt a vocational advice intervention for a broader group of patients and test it in a small sample of patients; followed by a pragmatic, multi-centre, two-arm, parallel-group randomised (1:1) trial with internal pilot phase, mixed methods process evaluation and health economic analysis.

Patients will be randomised to either (i) vocational advice intervention plus usual care, or (ii) usual care alone. The vocational advice intervention is designed as a stepped care model based on the principles of case management and delivered by trained Vocational Support Workers (VSWs).

The intervention consists of five core components underpinning the FOCUS acronym:

(F) supporting Family involvement, (O) supporting Outlook and meaning, (C) increasing Coping effectiveness, (U) reducing Uncertainty, and (S) Symptom management. Originally a nurse-delivered in-person intervention, FOCUS has been translated into a self-administered web-based intervention as part of an European study.

The overall aim of this project is to determine the effectiveness and sustainability of a digital health intervention (FOCUSau) aimed at improving the wellbeing and self-efficacy of patients with advanced cancer and their primary support person/carer.

A primary support person/carer is an unpaid individual identified by the person with advanced cancer (not necessarily a partner or family member) who is providing them with physical, social or emotional support. Hereafter referred to as a ""carer"". The term ""dyad"" refers to the patient and primary support person/carer.

The project objectives are:

1. adapt FOCUS to the Australian context and develop FOCUSau;
2. examine the effectiveness of FOCUSau in improving the wellbeing (primary outcomes: QoL and self-efficacy) of patients with advanced cancer and their primary family carer;
3. compare the type and costs of health service use by participants in the intervention and control group; and
4. assess the acceptability, feasibility and scalability of FOCUSau in order to inform sustainable implementation of the intervention within the Australian health care system.

A pragmatic phase III hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial with an integrated research design that includes digital health evaluation will be used in patients with advanced cancer and their primary support person/carer.

Data will be collected three times from patient-carer dyads:

1. at baseline (T0) after which the dyad will immediately be randomised to one of the study arms,

Preliminary evidence has previously shown that the autonomy supporting intervention, guided self-determination method might have effect on HbA1c and diabetes distress in people with type 1 diabetes. However, previous trials were all rated as high risk of bias and did not assess potential harm of the the intervention. Thus, in the current trial, the objective is to investigate the benefits and harms of guided self-determination interventions versus an attention control group intervention in adults with type 2 diabetes.

Methods/design The trial planned is a randomised, pragmatic, investigator-initiated, dual-centre, parallel group, clinical superiority trial of guided self-determination intervention versus an attention control group for people diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in outpatient clinics. The participants (n=224) will be recruited from the department of Endocrinology at a University hospital of Copenhagen, the Capital Region of Denmark and from Steno Diabetes Center Odense, University hospital in the Southern Region of Denmark. The experimental stepped-care intervention will consist of 3-5 analogue or digitally provided guided self-determination sessions lasting up to one hour with a guided self-determination facilitator. The attention control group will receive similar number of sessions lasting up to one hour with a communication trained healthcare professional provided face-to-face, digitally, or over telephone.This trial protocol is guided by the SPIRIT and CONSORT guidelines. Participants will be included if they have type 2 diabetes, \> 18 years old, and, are not pregnant. Participants will be assessed before randomisation, at 5- and 12-months follow-up.

The primary outcome is injurious falls, with secondary outcomes measuring how the process of care is changed and capturing patient-reported outcomes valued by stakeholders.

The main questions this study aims to answer are:

* Which of the three models is more effective in preventing falls with fractures?
* What are the differences in patient-centered outcomes amongst the three models? These include pain, depression, anxiety, sleep, medication side effect burden, and fear of falling.
* What are the differences in osteoporosis treatment and medication burden?

The three care models are: a Deprescribing Care Model designed to reduce or stop fall-related medications, a Bone Heath Service Model designed to provide osteoporosis evaluation and management, and an Injury Prevention Service Model offering both services.

42 SNFs will participate in this study. The three models will be incorporated into the routine care of patients at these facilities who are receiving rehabilitation after a hospitalization for a fracture. All care models will be delivered remotely to patients in the SNF and after they transition home by a post-fracture nurse consultant supported by an interprofessional team.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine, using a 5-week cross-over design, food-based intervention trial, the potential for inclusion of 'low-salt' bread as part of a pragmatic reduced-salt diet on blood pressure (BP) in adults with slightly to moderately elevated BP.

The study consisted of a randomized crossover trial of the effect of reduced-salt intake or usual-salt intake for 5 weeks on BP (as the primary outcome) in adults with slightly to moderately elevated BP (seated office systolic BP \>120 and \<160 mmHg or a diastolic BP \>80 and \<95 mmHg; identified by a pre-screening phase).

Subjects were randomly assigned to the reduced-salt diet or their usual-salt diet (control) for 5 weeks, followed by crossover to the alternative dietary regimen for a further 5 weeks. Subjects randomized to start on the reduced-salt diet were asked to restrict their consumption of dietary salt using a combination of pragmatic dietary advice as well as the replacement of bread and a limited number of other foods with equivalent foods which had lower salt content; these were provided to the participants. At the beginning of the salt restriction period, a research nutritionist provided the subjects with a list of the common salt-containing food and were asked to limit the consumption of such, as feasible.

In recent years, many studies have used the internet to promote PA in many settings, including the home environment, but only a few studies have recruited AAs. Without innovative and culturally relevant interventions, AAs will continue reporting extremely low levels of PA and disparate cardiovascular health outcomes. In prior work, the investigators sought the input of AA focus groups to inform the development of a technology-based Physical Activity for The Heart (PATH) intervention that leverages openly accessible platforms, such as YouTube, to promote PA in any setting. The investigators designed PATH as a culturally salient action-oriented intervention that can be accessed in any setting to promote PA among inactive AAs. In this application, the investigators propose to examine whether PATH is a feasible strategy for promoting PA among inactive AAs. In Aim 1 the investigators will conduct a randomized clinical trial that will include 30 inactive AAs to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the PATH intervention. In Aim 2 the investigators will examine the trend in PA and cardiovascular disease risk change from baseline to post-intervention. This approach is innovative because it leverages openly accessible technologies to provide a wide variety of free, enjoyable and action-oriented workout videos that match AAs preferences.

Neutrophil is a kind of defensive white blood cell combating against infection, especially by bacteria and fungi. Low neutrophil can be part of the disease progress or secondary to some cancer treatment. These participants are at high risk of developing infection-related complications including death.

Currently a dedicated clinical pathway has been in place in emergency department for suspected neutropenic fever, which offers fast-track medical consultation, blood tests and a very strong antibiotic (meropenem) as the first choice within 1 hour of registration. However, majority of such participants' neutrophil counts are not low. Most of them have no bacterial infection in the body, and have unremarkable short hospital stays. Early administration of meropenem in the majority of cases may be unnecessary and imposes risk of developing antibiotic resistance.

This study attempts to answer the question, ""In adult participants with cancer presenting to emergency department with suspected neutropenic fever, when compared with conventional treatment, can a new protocol guided by fast-track neutrophil count reduces prescription of meropenem?"" Agreed participants will be randomly assigned to the conventional treatment group, or the new treatment group. For those who are assigned to the new treatment group, blood will be taken and sent to the hospital laboratory for urgent analysis of neutrophil count. Participants with proven low neutrophil counts will still receive meropenem, while those without low neutrophil counts will receive less strong antibiotic according to their clinical diagnoses, such as Augmentin.

"1369","NCT05444361","Ultrasound-Guided Percutaneous Cryoneurolysis to Treat Postoperative Pain After Mastectomy","ENROLLING_BY_INVITATION","Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in women. Removal of the breast, called ""mastectomy"", is performed either when there is cancer-or an increased risk of cancer-in the breast. This can result in a lot of pain during the months after surgery. Opioids-""narcotics""-are the most common pain control method provided to patients; but they frequently do not relieve enough pain, have undesirable side effects like vomiting and constipation, and are sometimes misused which can lead to addiction. Mastectomy also frequently results in long-term pain which can interfere with physical and emotional functioning; and the more pain patients have immediately after surgery, the greater the risk of developing long-term pain. Numbing the nerves with local anesthetic can decrease the amount of short- and long-term pain experienced by patients, but even the longest types of these nerve blocks last for hours or days, and not the 1-2 months of pain typically following mastectomy. So, there is reason to believe that if the nerve blocks could be extended so that they last longer than the pain from surgery, short- and long-term pain might be avoided completely without the need for opioids. A prolonged nerve block may be provided by freezing the nerve using a technique called ""cryoneurolysis"". With cryoneurolysis and ultrasound machines, a small needle-like ""probe"" may be placed through anesthetized skin and guided to the target nerve to allow freezing. The procedure takes about 5 minutes for each nerve, involves little discomfort, has no side effects, and cannot be misused or become addictive. After 2-3 months, the nerve returns to normal functioning. The investigators have completed a small study suggesting that a single cryoneurolysis treatment may provide potent pain relief after mastectomy. The ultimate objectives of the proposed research study are to determine if temporarily freezing the nerves that go to the breast will decrease short-term pain, opioid use, physical and emotional dysfunction, and long-term pain following mastectomy when added to current and customary postoperative analgesics.

The current project is a pragmatic, multicenter, randomized, triple-masked (investigators, participants, statisticians), sham/placebo-controlled, parallel-arm, human-subjects, post-market clinical trial to determine if cryoneurolysis is an effective non-opioid treatment for pain following mastectomy.","NO","Mastectomy; Lymphedema","DEVICE: Cryoneurolysis|DEVICE: Sham Comparator","Opioid consumption during first 2 postoperative months, Cumulative opioid dose measured in oral oxycodone equivalents following recovery room discharge for 10 specific 24-hour time points over the first 2 months following surgery.

Stroke is a complex disease with multiple interacting risk factors (including genetic, high blood pressure and cholesterol, and lifestyle factors like smoking, diet, and exercise) that lead to initial and recurrent stroke. Up to 90% of stroke survivors have some functional deficit that impacts both physical and mental health.

Scientific evidence that identifies the best stroke care delivery design is lacking. We completed a three-year, Centers for Medicare \& Medicaid Services (CMS) Health Care Innovation Award that tested a new stroke care design called an Integrated Practice Unit (IPU). This IPU was developed through stakeholder input from patients, caregivers, nurses, stroke specialists, rehabilitation specialists, patient advocacy groups, payers, and technology companies. This IPU design was associated with decreased hospital length of stay, readmissions, and stroke recurrence, as well as lower cost.

Based on the CMS study, a larger, pragmatic trial was developed that is called C3FIT (Coordinated, Collaborative, Comprehensive, Family-based, Integrated, and Technology-enabled Stroke Care).

However, despite these results, the effectiveness of direct access to physiotherapy and its impact on costs has never been investigated in Belgium. Therefore, the goal of this study is to compare the (cost-)effectiveness of direct access to physiotherapy compared to usual care by the general practitioner (GP) for patients with acute LBP.

In this study, 600 patients with acute LBP (lasting \>24 hours and \<6 weeks) will be divided into two groups (Dutch-speaking: n=2x150; French-speaking n= 2x150). One group will receive treatment through direct access to the physiotherapist, without prescription by a GP. The other group will follow the traditional care pathway through the GP. Th effects on pain, disability and cost-effectiveness will be analysed using questionnaires obtained before and at the end of treatment, after 3 months, after one and after two years. Primary outcomes include pain and disability. Secondary outcomes include clinical outcomes, beliefs related to LBP, quality of life, patient satisfaction, but also direct health care costs, health care resource use, as well as absenteeism and productivity loss.

The results of this study will answer the question whether direct access to physiotherapy is (cost)effective for acute LBP.

The purpose of this study in primary care is to investigate if measurement of airway inflammation (FeNO) can improve the treatment results and the overall care of adult patients with asthma. The main question in the study is whether the use of FeNO measurements can reduce the number of deterioration periods. The study is conducted under real clinical conditions where the effect of the intervention is measured (pragmatic intervention study). Eight to twelve primary health care centers with functional asthma / COPD clinics are selected within the Stockholm County and are randomly assigned to two groups with four to six primary health care centers each, an active group and a control group (cluster randomization). Instruments for FeNO measurements are made available to the active group and this group is also trained on FeNO measurements and how the value should be interpreted and used to control the treatment, while the control group continues to take care of their asthma patients as usual. The study can lead to improved treatment decisions and patients gaining an increased understanding of their asthma by being informed on the actual degree of inflammation in the airways.

Therefore, in this pragmatic randomised controlled trial, the investigators will consider the Flemish current standard of care for frail older adults as a control group. Intervention condition 1 reflects the state-of-the-art physical activity intervention provided by professionals and intervention condition 2 consists of the same intervention provided by trained volunteers. It is hypothesized that the intervention in both intervention conditions will have significant effects on functional ability, cognition, loneliness, self-management, subjective health and meaningful activities and that it can alleviate the financial burden of condition 1 (cost-effectiveness). The pretrajectory of this study was based on the 'British Medical Research Council guidance' for the development and evaluation of complex interventions. This resulted in a comprehensive, state-of-the art personalised physical activity programme for community-dwelling frail older adults: ACTIVE-AGE@home. The programme adheres to current guidelines for physical activity and exercise for frail older adults and considers low threshold and meaningful activities for the participants. The latter perfectly aligns with the complex bio-psychosocial components of frailty. Positive results will help reduce negative outcomes of frailty in older adults and will also reduce health and social expenditures. This study aligns with a 'prevention and health promotion' model.","NO","Frailty","BEHAVIORAL: ACTIVE-AGE@home","The timed chair rise (TCR), The timed chair rise (TCR) is one of the most important functional evaluation clinical tests because it measures physical lower body strength and relates it to the most demanding ADLs (e.g., climbing stairs, getting out of a chair or bathtub, or rising from a horizontal position).

"1397","NCT05869656","THIRST Alert Trial","RECRUITING","The aim of this feasibility study is to determine whether an alert embedded within the electronic health record (EHR) causes clinicians to enrol patients into a randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing oral fluid restriction versus no restriction in patients admitted to hospital with fluid overload.

One of the main causes of fluid overload is heart failure where there is a lack of strong evidence to support the effectiveness of oral fluid restriction in the acute setting. This causes significant variation in clinical practice where decisions on whether or not to impose a restriction in oral fluid intake is based on the preference of the treating clinician rather than robust evidence from research.

THIRST Alert is a pragmatic randomised controlled trial (RCT), embedded in the EHR, which seeks to determine whether a computerised alert for the clinical team can change clinician behaviour during routine NHS care at University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (UCLH).

Patients with suspected fluid overload will be identified based on the prescription of intravenous furosemide, a medication used to stimulate diuresis (increased urine output) to remove excess fluid. A repeat prescription of intravenous furosemide within the first 48 hours of an unplanned admission will trigger the alert.

A clinician from the treating team will then be asked to consider enrolling the patient into the RCT if they judge that oral fluid restriction might be beneficial but they have uncertainty about this (clinical equipoise). Enrolled patients will be randomised to either oral fluid restriction of 1 litre per day or no fluid restriction. This will then be actioned through documenting as part of the clinical plan in the patients record and then communicated to the patient and the rest of the clinical team, including nursing staff.

The study will record the number of patients recruited into the trial and the effect of the alert on enrolled patients' subsequent oral fluid intake. There are no additional tests or follow up for patients and the trial finishes on discharge from the study site.

- Methods :

STOP is a randomised, multi-centre, single blinded, intent-to-treat trial. Participating centres include primary care practices (community, municipal or general health clinics), hospital-based facilities, and healthcare institutions specialised in addiction treatment. Smokers with low SEP will be randomised into either the intervention or control group.

Persons randomised to the control group will be accompanied by their health professional according to standard practice.

Participants randomised to the intervention group will receive the same smoking cessation advice, drug (varenicline, champix,..) prescription and support as participants in the control group, but they will also have a choice of being given free Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) (transdermal patch, gum, spray, inhaler, sublingual tablets/lozenges) and/or an electronic cigarette + e-liquid on the spot to aid their quit attempt.

The unit of randomization is the health facility (24 health facilities randomized). The trial tests a complex intervention-a two phase programmatic public health package which includes a standardized public health evaluation and analysis, to identify problems and barriers limiting Latent Tuberculosis Infection diagnosis and treatment among close contacts of active Tuberculosis cases. This will be followed by implementation of appropriate solutions and strengthening of the LTBI clinical program. The primary objective will be to estimate the increase the number of household contacts initiating LTBI treatment per newly diagnosed index patient, within 3 months of diagnosis of the index patient. A secondary objective is to evaluate the cost effectiveness of this two phase intervention. If successful, this approach can be expanded throughout these countries. After initial preparations, including administrative and ethical review, all participating sites will be randomized to intervention or control. Immediately after this, Phase 1 will begin in intervention sites with the standardized public health evaluation to identify barriers to LTBI diagnosis and treatment initiation and the selection of solutions to be used in Phase 2. To ensure standardization of data gathering research staff will use (i) current indicators of the Latent Tuberculosis Infection cascade of care in intervention facilities (number of contacts per index case registered, investigated, started on treatment and completing treatment) and (ii) interviewer administered questionnaires for patients with active pulmonary Tuberculosis, adult and child household contacts and clinic staff. These questionnaires will assess latent Tuberculosis-related knowledge, attitudes and beliefs from the perspective of these different participants. Results from intervention sites in Phase 1 will be analyzed, and used by the investigators, together with local public health officials, to decide on appropriate corrective solutions in each sites. Contact Investigation registries will also be developed with research staff from sites.

"1419","NCT04927871","Hybridized Three Steps Intervention to Prevent Diabetes in Venezuela","COMPLETED","The American Diabetes Association recommends implementing the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) in subjects with prediabetes. In the DPP, weight reduction was the main predictor of a lower incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D), each kilogram lost was related with 16% lower incidence. However, the effectiveness of the DPP in primary care settings is lower than the original study. A meta-analysis of 36 pragmatic clinical trials of DPP in primary care settings showed a reduction in T2D incidence by 26%, less than half than the original study (58%), with a pooled mean weight loss 1.57 kg higher than standard care, demonstrating the large difficulties to reduce weight of participants at community levels. Total diet replacement (TDR) with low-energy liquid-diet or solid diet (825-853 kcal/day) is an effective strategy to reduce weight. The effectiveness of an intervention including initial rapid weight loss before starting the DPP is ignored in primary care levels in Venezuela. We aim: 1- To compare the weight loss achieved of two lifestyle intervention programs in a community health center of Venezuela: a) A hybrid lifestyle including rapid weight loss with total diet replacement (TDR), then medical nutrition therapy (MNT), and the DPP, VS b) only the DPP; 2- To evaluate the change of cardiometabolic risk factors between groups; 3- To evaluate the implementation process. Our hypothesis is: after six months of intervention, subjects receiving a hybridized lifestyle (TDR+MNT+DPP) will double the weight loss of those that only receive DPP.","NO","Obesity|Overweight|PreDiabetes|Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2|Risk Factor, Cardiovascular","BEHAVIORAL: Total Diet Replacement (TDR)|BEHAVIORAL: Medical Nutritional Therapy (MNT)|BEHAVIORAL: Diabetes Prevention Program 4 months|BEHAVIORAL: Diabetes Prevention Program","Change of weight in kilograms, The difference of change of weight in kilograms between the arms of the intervention, 6 months","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,156,"NETWORK","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: PREVENTION","2020-11-16","2021-11-23","2022-01-15","2021-06-16","","2022-03-16","Maria M.

In a cluster-randomized controlled trial, the efficacy of a guideline-based multicomponent intervention has been shown with a significant reduction in physical restraints use without adverse events. The present study aims to apply different versions of the original intervention in nursing home residents in four different regions throughout Germany in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the programme.

Methods/Design: Pragmatic cluster-randomized controlled trial comparing two intervention groups ((1) updated original programme and (2) brief version of the updated programme) with a control group (3) receiving printed study materials (optimized usual care). Intervention (1) consists of an information programme for all nurses, additional training and structured support for nominated key nurses, and provision of printed study material and other supportive material. For intervention (2) nurses' training is only optional carried out facultatively by key nurses who have received an additional train-the-trainer module. The control group (3) receives printed study material only. Overall, 120 nursing homes including approximately 10800 residents will be recruited, randomized to one of the three groups and followed up for 12 months. The primary outcome is defined as proportion of residents with at least one physical restraint at 12 months. Physical restraint use will be assessed by direct observation. Secondary outcomes are residents' quality of life as well as safety parameters as i.g. falls and fall-related fractures.

"1422","NCT05806645","UPTAKE: Using Personalized Risk and Digital Tools to Guide Transitions Following Acute Kidney Events","NOT_YET_RECRUITING","Nearly one in ten people who are hospitalized in Canada develop a complication with sudden loss of kidney function, called acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI may lead to other severe health problems after discharge home, such as kidney failure requiring dialysis treatment, heart failure, heart attacks, stroke, and even premature death. Discharge from hospital to home can be a difficult transition where there are often gaps in identification, communication, care coordination, education, and planning of care for AKI. The study team will co-design and evaluate a tailored post-discharge care plan that is based on the risk of later kidney problems and uses currently available, yet untapped digital innovation to improve the health and experience of people with AKI.

This study will be built into Alberta's new provincial electronic health record (EHR). The plan is to use digital tools in the EHR to identify all people in Alberta hospitals that have had an AKI event and are at increased risk of long-term complications. Half will randomly be assigned to receive a tailored care plan based on their risk at hospital discharge while the other half will receive care as it is currently provided by their healthcare team. The electronic health system will automatically calculate a patient's risk and report this risk in their chart along with recommendations for care. The study team includes patients, healthcare providers, and health system decision makers needed to co-develop the proposed strategy and introduce the changes needed to deliver this intervention. The investigators will study whether this strategy can reduce health problems that may happen after AKI including death, need for dialysis, heart attacks, and stroke. The investigators will also determine if the approach improves patient experience during the transition from hospital to home. This study has the potential to revolutionize how we care for people that leave hospital after having AKI.","NO","Acute Kidney Injury","OTHER: Risk-guided transition of care intervention delivered through an integrated digital health strategy","Primary effectiveness outcome, The primary outcome of the study is major adverse kidney or CV events at 1 year, defined as the composite of death, kidney failure (receipt of maintenance dialysis or eGFR \< 15 mL/min/1.73m2 for 4 weeks or more), or hospitalization with a most responsible diagnosis for heart failure, myocardial infarction, or stroke (based on validated ICD-10 coding algorithms), 1 year","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,6046,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE (INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","2024-04-02","2027-09","2028-09","2023-04-10","","2023-10-11","","other"

A novel, non-pharmacologic analgesic technique-percutaneous peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS)- holds extraordinary potential to greatly reduce or obviate opioid requirements and concurrently improve analgesia following painful surgery. This technique involves inserting an insulated electric lead adjacent to a target nerve through a needle prior to surgery using ultrasound guidance. Following surgery, a tiny electric current is delivered to the nerve resulting in potent pain control without any cognitive or adverse systemic side effects whatsoever. The electrical pulse generator (stimulator) is so small it is simply affixed to the patient's skin. The leads are already cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat acute (postoperative) pain for up to 60 days; and, since percutaneous PNS may be provided on an outpatient basis, the technique holds the promise of providing potent analgesia outlasting the pain of surgery-in other words, the possibility of a painless, opioid-free recovery following surgery.

The current project is a multicenter, randomized, quadruple-masked, placebo/sham-controlled, parallel-arm pragmatic clinical trial to determine the effects of percutaneous PNS on postoperative analgesia and opioid requirements, as well as physical and emotional functioning, the development of chronic pain, and ongoing quality of life.","NO","Rotator Cuff Repair|Ankle Arthroplasty or Arthrodesis|Hallux Valgus (Bunion) Resection","DEVICE: Peripheral Nerve Stimulation|DEVICE: Sham","Opioid consumption during first postoperative week, Cumulative opioid dose following recovery room discharge for days 0-7, Postoperative days 0-7, collected on days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 for the previous 24 hours at each time point.|Average pain during first postoperative week, Mean value of the ""average"" pain scores following recovery room discharge measured using the numeric rating scale.

The treatment algorithm was developed from the results of a survey of SIBO treatment preferences of rheumatologists and gastroenterologists. Although the drugs in the algorithm are already used in SSc, there is no uniform way of doing this and assessing the patient response. A very standardized protocol was created with details of how to use the medications, the duration of use and the timing of different drugs. In addition, symptoms of SIBO will be dectected by having patients complete a validated screening questionnaire, the global symptomatic score (GSS), online every 3 months for the duration of the study. A score \> 5 is very strongly related to bacterial overgrowth. In other studies, about 40% of unselected patients score at this level. This same questionnaire will be used in the T2T doctors' offices to decide if response is adequate and will also be used to assess outcome in the algorithm group versus standard care group.

The primary outcome is the change in symptoms based on the total GSS. Secondary outcomes will include examination of all GSS subscales. HRQoL will be assessed by the social scale of the newly developed UCLA SSc GIT 2.0 questionnaire, which has become the standard GI questionnaire in SSc trials.

"1431","NCT03259698","Optimizing the Delivery of HIV nPEP","UNKNOWN","Despite decades of traditional prevention efforts based on behavior change and condom use, Ontario has seen over 700 new HIV infections annually over the past 10 years. Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is one such approach, in which uninfected persons use 28 days of antiretroviral medications (ARVs) shortly after an HIV exposure to minimize the risk of acquiring HIV. PEP is highly efficacious, is considered a standard of care intervention based on medical and ethical grounds, and is supported by treatment guidelines. Yet several implementation challenges have limited its clinical and public health impact in Ontario, where no formal PEP policy exists. Our proposal seeks to optimize two aspects of delivering PEP for sexual exposures (nPEP). Results will inform the development of a standardized approach to nPEP both province-wide and elsewhere.

Thus study has pragmatic, multicenter randomized controlled trial using a 2x2 factorial design to determine whether the proportion of nPEP patients that successfully complete follow-up:

1. is higher among those receiving mobile phone-based text messaging support than among those receiving standard care; and
2. is non-inferior among those receiving care from a sexual health clinic nurse compared to those receiving hospital-based physician care.

The prospective, randomized, non-blinded, 2x2 factorial trial that will enroll 318 study participants in Toronto. In Intervention A, we will randomize half of study participants to a text messaging support service ('WelTel'), in which a trained, community-based counselor provides standardized weekly 'check-in' messages during their 12-week course of PEP follow-up. The other half will receive standard care, which does not include any form of active outreach or reminders outside of scheduled appointments. In Intervention B, we will randomize half of participants to receive nurse-led care for PEP follow-up at a local sexual health clinic; the other half will receive standard care by a hospital-based ID physician. The specific activities for each follow-up visit will be clearly defined in a medical directive. In keeping with Ontario legislation on medical directives, nurses will review cases with their authorizing physician or nurse practitioner on a routine basis.","NO","HIV Infections","DRUG: nPEP|BEHAVIORAL: Text Messaging Support|OTHER: Nurse-Led nPEP","Self-reported completion of a full course of PEP medications and receipt of a final HIV test result from their nPEP provider 12 weeks after the index exposure, Determined by patient completion of acceptability questionnaire and evidence of HIV test result, 12 weeks","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT","PHASE2",434,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: SEQUENTIAL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT","2021-11-04","2022-12","2023-08","2017-08-24","","2021-11-22","HIV Prevention Clinic (Toronto General Hospital), Toronto, Ontario, Canada|Positive Care Clinic (St. Michael's Hospital), Toronto, Ontario, Canada|Crossways Sexual Health Clinic (TPH), Toronto, Canada","drug"

"1443","NCT03274947","The Utility of Cerebellar Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in the Neurorehabilitation of Dysphagia After Stroke","COMPLETED","The study is designed to explore the effectiveness of non-invasive cerebellar stimulation to enhance motor plasticity in the cortex after stroke. The investigators have shown that the human cerebellum is strongly activated during the act of swallowing and when stimulated with single TMS pulses can strongly facilitate the corticobulbar projection to the pharynx in humans. More recently the investigators have identified the most relevant frequency of stimulation of the cerebellum that can produce longer term excitation in the human swallowing motor system. The investigators therefore believe that the potential for cerebellar stimulation in improving swallowing is much greater than other methods for two reasons. Firstly, previous work has shown that unlike successful recovery of hand/arm function which relies on restoring activity in the stroke hemisphere, recovery of swallowing function relies on increased excitability in intact projections from the non-stroke hemisphere. The investigators believe that methods that can enhance these undamaged pathways have a greater chance of inducing recovery in the human swallowing system in unilateral stroke. Additionally cerebellar stimulation produces very high levels of corticobulbar excitation it may also have the advantage of improving dysphagia in posterior fossa strokes. Second, the human cerebellum is relatively easy to target and stimulate and has reduced risk of inducing unwanted effects (such as seizures) which as a consequence makes cerebellar stimulation a more pragmatic method for delivering therapeutic neurorehabilitation to dysphagic stroke patients compared to other more complex/riskier methods.

A final factor is that the investigators have developed a ""virtual lesion"" model of swallowing dysfunction in healthy volunteers which can be reversed quite successfully with other neuro-stimulation protocols. The investigators can therefore use this model to test the effectiveness of cerebellar stimulation protocols (ipsilateral and contralateral cerebellar sites) before choosing the most effective side to apply stimulation in a proof of principle trial/study in a small group of sub-acute dysphagic patients.

The hypotheses are that cerebellar TMS will:

i. Reverse the brain inhibition and behavioural dysfunction following a virtual lesion model of disrupted swallowing in healthy brain (phase 1); ii. Reduce the degree of aspiration in acute dysphagia after a stroke (phase 2).","NO","Oropharyngeal Dysphagia|Stroke","DEVICE: Cerebellar TMS|DEVICE: Sham cerebellar TMS","Penetration aspiration scores on videofluoroscopy (number of swallows out of 6 that score 3 or more on the penetration aspiration scale) (Hypothesis 2 protocols 1 and 2), Penetration aspiration scores on videofluoroscopy (number of swallows out of 6 that score 3 or more on the penetration aspiration scale), 1 hour post intervention and 2 weeks post intervention","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,15,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (PARTICIPANT)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT","2019-01-14","2022-06-30","2022-10-31","2017-09-07","","2022-12-01","Upper G.I laboratory, Salford Royal Hospital, Manchester, Greater Manchester, M6 8HD, United Kingdom|Stroke Unit, Nottingham University Hospitals, Nottingham, Notthinghamshire, United Kingdom","device"

"1451","NCT05977556","Perioperative Prehabilitation on Markers of Fitness and Frailty in Patients Undergoing Elective Surgery","SUSPENDED","A growing body of evidence suggests that patients who receive good perioperative care (i.e. care prior to surgery, during surgery, and after surgery) tend to have fewer complications, quicker recovery times, and shorter hospital stays. A key component of good perioperative care is recognizing individuals who have diminished physiological reserves (i.e. those who are vulnerable or frail). The stress of an invasive procedure can exhaust the diminished reserves of patients who are frail, which can in turn lead to perioperative complications, mortality and an increase burden to the healthcare system.

Early interventions in patients with diminished reserves can be applied to reduce the risk of complications and poor outcomes. There are emerging studies that show promising benefits of perioperative interventions, such as prehabilitation, though with some mixed findings. Exercise has been shown to reverse or modify the molecular driving factors of frailty, which involve dysregulation of cytokine and endocrine pathways.

Physical inactivity and prolonged sedentary behaviors are also emerging concerns in frailty because of the implicated deleterious health effects. Sedentary behaviors are associated with prevalence and severity of frailty. Among pre-frail and frail inactive adults, sedentary time is associated with higher mortality. Increasing physical activity is recommended as the most feasible approach to prevent and treat frailty. The aim of this study is to determine if a prehabilitation intervention that combines neuromuscular strength training and intervention to reduce sedentary behavior reduces complications, length of stay, and patient recovery, thereby also reducing the burden on the healthcare system.","NO","Frailty","BEHAVIORAL: Combined neuromuscular exercise training and 'sit less, move more' program","Change from baseline gait speed at 12 and 24 weeks, Comfortable walking speed will be assessed over a 5-meter walkway, 12 and 24 weeks","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT","PHASE1",50,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: PREVENTION","2026-01","2028-03","2028-03","2023-08-04","","2024-02-15","Royal Alexandra Hospital, Edmonton, Canada","behavioral"

Targeting antibiotic use to the few patients with a high probability of benefit and withholding in the many with non-serious respiratory infection is a promising strategy and readily implemented in clinical practice.

The Procalcitonin guided Antibiotics in Respiratory Infections (PARI) study will assess the effect of a novel point-of-care PCT guided antibiotic stewardship in acute respiratory tract infections in general practice.

The overall aim of the PARI study is to reduce antibiotic use in patients with acute respiratory tract infections by targeting antibiotic treatment only to patients with a suspected bacterial etiology and thus likely to benefit from antibiotic therapy.

The main research questions are:

Does the addition of a point-of-care Procalcitonin test to standard care reduce antibiotic use in primary care? Is the intervention safe for the patients? The PARI study is a pragmatic two-arm (intervention and control (standard care) open randomized non-inferiority trial (up to 1 day difference in recovery) in general practice.","NO","Acute Respiratory Tract Infection","DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Procalcitonin","Duration of illness and symptoms from acute respiratory tract infections., The patient reported primary outcome will be assessed as number of days to a patient's daily activities (work or recreation) are no longer restricted by symptoms from a respiratory tract infection.The non-inferiority margin between the intervention and control group is set at a one day difference.

"1458","NCT02626377","Multicenter Prospective Cohort of Informal Caregivers in Burgundy and Franche-Comté","TERMINATED","Medical progress and modification of lifestyles have prolonged life expectancy, despite the development of chronic diseases. The support and care are often provided by a network of informal caregivers composed of family, friends, and neighbors. They became essential to help maintening the elderly persons to live at home. It has been demonstrated that the importance and the diversity of informal tasks may jeopardize their own physical, mental and social well-being.

The aim of the Informal Carers of Elderly Cohort is to define, through a longitudinal study of their life course, the profiles of caregivers of patients with a diagnosis of one of the following diseases: cancer (breast, prostate, colon-rectum), neuro-degenerative diseases (Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's and similar diseases), neuro-vascular diseases (Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA)), Age-related Macular Degeneration(AMD) and heart disease (heart failure), aged ≥ 60 years old and living in Burgundy or Franche-Comte. By following the different phases of the caregiving relationship from the announcement of the diagnosis, it will be possible to assess the quality of life of caregivers and evaluate the implementation of a pragmatic social action to help informal caregivers through a randomized intervention trial nested in the cohort.

Thanks to an analytical and longitudinal definition of the profiles of informal caregivers, this study could gather precise information on their life courses and their health trajectory by identifying the consequences associated with the concept of their role of aid in care. In addition, the randomized intervention trial will explore the efficacy, in terms of quality of life, and efficiency of a social action to support the caregivers. These data will allow to identify strategies that could be used to improve the existing sources of aid and to propose new approaches to help caregivers. This study will provide the opportunity to identify the most relevant means of support and to give an impulse for new healthcare policies.","NO","Breast Cancer|Colorectal Cancer|Prostate Cancer|Alzheimer Disease|Age-related Macular Degeneration|Parkinson Disease|Cardiac Disease|Ischemic Stroke|Hemorrhagic Stroke","BEHAVIORAL: Support provided by social worker|OTHER: Information booklet receipt","(Interventional Study) Comparison of caregivers' HRQoL according to the allocated intervention by randomization based on summaries score the MOS SF36, The main objective of the randomized study is to compare the Health Related Quality of Life based on summaries score the MOS SF36 one year after randomization according to the allocated intervention., One year after randomization|(Observational study) Changes in HRQoL of patients' caregivers using the MOS SF36 questionnaire, The main objective of the observational study is to define the longitudinal profiles of patient's caregivers according to the evaluation of their HRQoL using the MOS SF36 questionnaire, At 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15,18, 21, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54 and 60 months post-randomization|(Observational study) Changes in HRQoL of cancer patients' caregivers using the CarGoQoL questionnaire, the aim of the observational study is to define the longitudinal profiles of cancer patient's caregivers according to the evaluation of their HRQoL using the CarGoQoL questionnaire, At 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48,54 and 60 months post-randomization|(Observational study) Changes in the coping strategies of patients' caregivers using the Borteyrou, Rascle and Truchot Questionnaire, The aim of the observational study is to define the longitudinal profiles of patient's caregivers according to the evaluation of their coping strategies using the Borteyrou, Rascle and Truchot Questionnaire., At 1, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months post-randomization|(Observational study) Changes in feelings of anxiety and depression of patients' caregivers according to the HADs questionnaire, The aim of the observational study is to define the longitudinal profiles of patient's caregivers according to the evaluation of their anxiety and depression according to the HADs questionnaire., At 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48,54 and 60 months post-randomization|(Observational study) Changes in social support of patients' caregivers using the SSQ6 questionnaire, The aim of the observational study is to define the longitudinal profiles of patient's caregivers according to the evaluation of their social support using the SSQ6 questionnaire., At 1, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months post-randomization|(Observational study) Changes in burden of patients' caregivers using the Zarit burden inventory, The aim of the observational study is to define the longitudinal profiles of patient's caregivers according to the evaluation burden using the Zarit burden inventory, At 1, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months post-randomization","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,186,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: OTHER","2015-10","2019-05","2019-05","2015-12-10","","2023-10-23","CHRU de Besançon, Besançon, 25030, France","behavioral"

Therefore, the burden on Korean society will also increase.

Thrice-weekly hemodialysis is standard for renal replacement therapy. However, this regimen has not been validated for elderly ESKD patients with residual renal function. Elderly patients can have multiple comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and impaired physical activity. Frequent hemodialysis could provoke falls, hypotension, and cognitive impairment. Previous reports have suggested the potential benefit of twice-weekly hemodialysis with incremental increases in frequency when residual renal function decreases. In addition, twice-weekly hemodialysis decreases hospitalization rates in frail patients.

Therefore, the investigators hypothesized initiating renal replacement therapy with twice-weekly hemodialysis decreases the hopsitalizatoin rates compared with conventional thrice-weekly hemodialysis in elderly ESRD patients with residual renal function. This study is a pragmatic randomized clinical trial, multicenter study. Study subjects are incident ESRD patients (\>= 60 years old, n=428) with residual urine volume ( \> 500 mL/day) and follow up up to 2 years.

"1473","NCT04621045","Active You: Feasibility of a Unique Physical Activity Program to Prevent Diabetes and Heart Disease","COMPLETED","Individuals who are overweight/obese are more vulnerable to type 2 diabetes (T2D). Current evidence suggests that PA, even without dietary prescription, can be efficacious in preventing T2D. Yet most Americans, especially those who are overweight/obese, are not physically active. Socioenvironmental barriers to physical activity (PA) such as body image concerns and limited access to fitness facilities contribute to the low levels of PA observed in overweight/obese adults. Web-based PA programs have been developed to address these barriers, but the outcomes have been marginal. Qualitative studies suggest that individuals who are overweight/obese prefer PA programs that feature people they can relate to especially in body size, fitness status and age. Previously, the investigators have included these preferences in a technology-based Physical Activity for The Heart (PATH) intervention that leverages open source platforms, such as YouTube, to promote PA in any setting. In this application, the investigators propose to test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of PATH in promoting PA and reducing cardiometabolic risk in adults who are overweight/obese and at high risk of diabetes. In Aim 1 the investigators will conduct a 12-week randomized clinical trial including 52 adults who are overweight/obese and at high risk of diabetes to assess the feasibility and acceptability of PATH. In Aim 2 investigators will examine the trend in PA and cardiometabolic risk change from baseline to post-intervention. This approach is innovative because it leverages open source technologies to provide low-cost, action-oriented PA resources that match the preferences of adults who are overweight/obese. This contribution will be significant because PATH could offer a convenient, enjoyable and scalable program that features ""similar others"" to promote PA in overweight/obese adults at high risk of diabetes.","NO","Cardiovascular Risk Factor|Prediabetes|Overweight and Obesity|Sedentary Behavior","BEHAVIORAL: The Physical Activity for The Heart (PATH) intervention|BEHAVIORAL: Be Active Your Way Booklet","Recruitment feasibility, Will be indicated by ability to recruit, screen, and enroll the target sample within 6 months of commencing recruitment, and retention of ≥80% of the sample., At the end of study approximately 48 weeks after commencement of the study|Feasibility of self-monitoring step count using wrist worn ActiGraph GT9X, will be indicated by the proportion of the sample with ≥4days per week of valid Actigraph wear time (≥10hrs) during the entire course of the study., At the end of study approximately 52 weeks after commencement of the study|Acceptability of PATH intervention, Will be indicated by utilization data that will be collected via Web analytics, and a post-intervention survey will assess the intervention acceptability., At the end of study approximately 52 weeks after commencement of the study","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,52,"OTHER","INTERVENTIONAL","Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: PREVENTION","2020-10-27","2022-03-12","2022-03-12","2020-11-09","","2022-10-07","Primay Health Network, Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, 15010, United States|University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 15261, United States","behavioral"

In sequence, this pilot study and larger RCT are grounded in the PRECEDE-PROCEED implementation science framework. The pilot study has four components: 1) a qualitative component will be used to design a docu-drama, 2) key informant interviews to guide intervention development, 3) a simultaneous randomized pilot trial will evaluate the feasibility of the larger trial design of communication interventions using WhatsApp compared to control, and 4) a final mixed- methods (quantitative survey and focus groups) assessment of participant views of acceptability, effectiveness, feasibility and cultural appropriateness of the two proposed communication interventions.

OBJECTIVES The three objectives of this pilot study are the careful design of a novel docu- drama communication intervention and WhatsApp intervention, evaluation of the feasibility of a larger RCT of communication strategies, and assessment of participant views of the two proposed communication interventions and control among first time blood donors within the catchment areas of the SZBC.

For the purposes of registration for clinicaltrials.gov only the randomized pilot trial communication interventions using WhatsApp compared to control is reported.

AIRCRAFT compares two medication classes commonly used for rate control in patients in atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular rate (RVR). The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility and approach to conducting a trial that compares the use of IV beta blockers and IV calcium channel blockers for patients in AF with RVR in the medical intensive care unit (MICU). AF with RVR is considered when the following parameters are met: (1) Cardiac rhythm consistent with AF (2) Heart rate \> 110 bpm. AF with RVR recurrence after conversion to sinus rhythm or prior rate control will count as a new episode of AF with RVR. Rate control agents will be pseudo-randomized to each of the three different MICU teams (beta-blocker, calcium channel blocker and physician preference). Patients are admitted to the three MICU teams on a rotating basis which will allow for pseudo-randomization, the effects of which will be equal between the three teams. Patients will be enrolled in the study if they develop AF with RVR and will be followed until discharge from the MICU. This study aims to assess the adherence and fidelity to treatment assignments in the current novel pilot study protocol which will help inform the feasibility of a larger-scale efficacy trial between IV beta blockers and IV calcium channel blockers for initial management of AF with RVR. Assessment of adherence and fidelity to treatment assignments in management of AF with RVR in the MICU will help inform power calculations and the percent of patients in each study group that received the assigned class of medication will help inform feasibility.

"1481","NCT04906447","Hybrid Effectiveness-Implementation Trial of Guided Relaxation and Acupuncture for Chronic Sickle Cell Disease Pain","RECRUITING","The investigators will conduct a hybrid type 1 effectiveness implementation trial to assess the effectiveness of acupuncture and guided relaxation on 360 people with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD), while observing and gathering information on implementation in three health systems: University of Illinois Hospital \& Health Sciences System, University of Florida Health, and Duke University Health Systems. Each serves a large population with SCD, uses EPIC as their electronic health record, and has a Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA), which will help speed the translation of discovery into improved patient care. During the UH3 Implementation Phase, the 3-arm, 3-site randomized controlled trial will follow a quantitative modified SMART design, a pragmatic trial that evaluates adaptive interventions where the guided relaxation and acupuncture interventions respond to patients' characteristics and evolving pain status. The investigators rely on the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to plan, execute, and evaluate associated implementation processes. The use of complementary and integrative health (CIH) therapies by those with SCD to reduce pain and opioid use, to help enable them to better cope with their pain, is well known, but there are few studies that evaluate the effectiveness of these therapies, and none that also evaluates the implementation across multiple health care systems and patient populations as this study will.

Aim 1: Determine the effectiveness of guided relaxation and acupuncture as compared to usual care in decreasing pain and opioid use for SCD patients. Hypothesis: At 6-weeks, SCD patients randomized to either CIH intervention will have a greater decrease in pain, opioid use, sleep, anxiety, depressive symptoms, and pain catastrophizing compared to SCD patients randomized to usual care.

Aim 2: Identify the best adaptive intervention for improved outcomes by documenting outcomes among adaptive intervention sequences: (1) initiate guided relaxation and switch to acupuncture for non-responders at midpoint; (2) initiate guided relaxation and continue with guided relaxation for non-responders at midpoint; (3) initiate acupuncture and switch to guided relaxation for non-responders at midpoint or (4) initiate acupuncture and continue with acupuncture for non-responders at midpoint.

"1484","NCT04058977","Redefining Survivorship: POWER to Maximize Physical Function for Survivors of Critical Illness","WITHDRAWN","Patients surviving critical illness experience significant skeletal muscle dysfunction and weakness. Muscle atrophy suffered during critical illness has a long-term impact on the functionality and mobility of these individuals. As a result, individuals surviving critical illness have a significant reduction in quality of life, even up to 5 years post discharge. Research including large randomized controls demonstrates that rehabilitation focused on active mobilization may positively influence patient outcomes. Thus, early mobilization is an important intervention that has many purported benefits. Current rehabilitation practice in the intensive care unit (ICU) and recommendations from clinical practice guidelines such as the Society of Critical Care Medicine, PADIS Guidelines support these interventions to reduce the detrimental effects of immobilization during critical illness. Early mobilization is routinely thought of as standard of care for patients admitted for acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis. However, a significant number of recent randomized controlled trials implementing early rehabilitation and mobilization interventions fail to demonstrate immediate or long-term benefits.10,11,18,19 Interesting, active mobilization and rehabilitation analyzed in systematic review had no impact on mortality and ""no consistent effects of function, quality of life and ICU or hospital length of stay.""18 There are a few potential explanations for interventions not leading to reduction in impairment or functional benefit.

Scientific Premise: From our preliminary data (Figure 1) and my clinical experience, a significant cause of the physical impairments in these patients is reductions in muscular power. Muscular power is a critical determinant of functional mobility.20 Preliminary data demonstrate that lower extremity muscle power is significantly reduced in this population and furthermore, these deficits are strongly correlated to physical function. Muscle power training is a potential therapeutic intervention that could lead to more robust improvements in physical function. This concept has been explored extensively in community-dwelling older adults. A recent systematic review of controlled trials demonstrates that power training is superior to traditional resistance training at improving functional performance when comparing the two training modalities.21 Furthermore, power training is feasible for older adults and clinical populations of Parkinson's Disease, Stroke, and frailty.22-27 Thus the feasibility and pragmatic nature of power training is not a concern. Of interest, a randomized controlled trial was completed in institutionalized frail nonagenarians (\>85 years or older).27 In this study, no patients drop-out of study due to power training and significant benefits in function were achieved.27 Therefore, the investigators propose a interventional trial to study the effect of a standardized muscle power training program for patients admitted to the ICU for critical illness.","NO","Critical Illness|Muscle Atrophy or Weakness","OTHER: Power training","Short Performance Physical Battery, This outcome measure is scored from 0-12 with lower scores representing disability and higher scores representing better physical function.
